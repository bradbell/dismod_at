$section mixed_cppad Derived Class Constructor$$

$head Syntax$$
$icode%mixed_derived% %mixed_object%(
	%n_fixed%, %n_random%, %quasi_fixed%, %...%
)%$$

$head See Also$$
$cref/initialize/mixed_cppad_initialize/$$

$head mixed_derived$$
This is the name of the class derived in the following fashion:
$codei%
	class %mixed_derived% : public dismod_at::mixed_cppad {
%$$
The derived class constructor must call its base class constructor as follows:
$codei%
	mixed_cppad(%n_fixed%, %n_random%, %quasi_fixed%)
%$$

$head mixed_object$$
This is the derived class object that is constructed by the syntax above.

$head n_fixed$$
This argument has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %n_fixed%
%$$
and is the number of
$cref/fixed effects/mixed_cppad/Fixed Effects, theta/$$ in the model.

$head n_random$$
This argument has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %n_random%
%$$
and is the number of
$cref/random effects/mixed_cppad/Random Effects, u/$$ in the model.
In the case where there are
$cref/no random effects/mixed_cppad/Problem/No Random Effects/$$,
$icode%n_random% = 0%$$.

$head quasi_fixed$$
This argument has prototype
$codei%
	bool %quasi_fixed%
%$$
If it is true, a quasi-Newton method is used to
$cref/optimize the fixed effects/mixed_cppad_optimize_fixed/$$.
Otherwise a full Newton method is used.
The full Newton method requires much more memory for computation
of second derivatives of the Laplace approximation.

$head ...$$
Other arguments to the derived class constructor
(that are not used by the base class constructor).

$head Example$$
The file $cref mixed_derived_xam.cpp$$ contains an example
that uses this derived class.
