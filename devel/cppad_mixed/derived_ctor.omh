$section cppad_mixed Derived Class Constructor$$

$head Syntax$$
$icode%mixed_derived% %mixed_object%(%n_fixed%, %n_random%, %...%)%$$

$head See Also$$
$cref/initialize/cppad_mixed_initialize/$$

$head mixed_derived$$
This is the name of the class derived in the following fashion:
$codei%
	class %mixed_derived% : public dismod_at::cppad_mixed {
%$$
The derived class constructor must call its base class constructor as follows:
$codei%
	cppad_mixed(%n_fixed%, %n_random%)
%$$

$head mixed_object$$
This is the derived class object that is constructed by the syntax above.

$head n_fixed$$
This is the number of
$cref/fixed effects/cppad_mixed/Fixed Effects, theta/$$ in the model.

$head n_random$$
This is the number of
$cref/random effects/cppad_mixed/Random Effects, u/$$ in the model.
In the case where there are
$cref/no random effects/cppad_mixed/Problem/No Random Effects/$$,
$icode%n_random% = 0%$$.

$head ...$$
Other arguments to the derived class constructor
(that are not used by the base class constructor).

$head Example$$
The file $cref mixed_derived_xam.cpp$$ contains an example
that uses this derived class.
