The Covariate and Multiplier Bound Table
########################################

bnd_mulcov_id
*************
This column has type ``integer`` and is the primary key for this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.
The ``bnd_mulcov_id`` column is also a foreign key for the
:ref:`mulcov_table-name` ; i.e.,

   *mulcov_id* = *bnd_mulcov_id*

In addition, the size of both tables is the same.

max_cov_diff
************
This column has type *real* and contains the maximum absolute difference
of the covariate minus its reference (for this covariate multiplier).

#. This maximum is restricted to the data table covariate values
   that have :ref:`data_subset_table@data_id`
   in the data_subset table.
#. This maximum is further restricted to the covariate column
   corresponding to the :ref:`mulcov_table@covariate_id`
   for this covariate multiplier.
#. If the :ref:`mulcov_table@mulcov_type`
   for this multiplier is ``rate_value`` ,
   :ref:`mulcov_table@integrand_id` for this multiplier is null
   and the maximum is respect to all integrands.
#. If the *mulcov_type* for this multiplier is not ``rate_value`` ,
   :ref:`mulcov_table@integrand_id` for this multiplier is not null
   and the maximum is further restricted the that integrand.

If this value is zero, the corresponding covariate multiplier does not
affect the model value for any of the data included during a fit.

max_mulcov
**********
This column has type ``real`` , is non-negative.
The value *max_mulcov* is a maximum for the
upper limit for the corresponding covariate multiplier during optimization.
The value ``-`` *max_mulcov* is a minimum for the
lower limit for the corresponding covariate multiplier during optimization.
This maximum and minimum are in addition to the priors for the multiplier.
If *max_mulcov* is null,
it is interpreted as plus infinity and has no effect.
Also, in the special case where the prior upper and lower limits are equal,
this maximum and minimum are ignored (have no effect).
