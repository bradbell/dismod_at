Release Notes for 2017
######################

mm-dd
*****

12-30
=====
Advance to using ``cppad_mixed-20171230`` .
This uses the CppAD subgraph method to compute the Hessian
with respect to the random effects.
It is expected to be faster on large problems, but more testing is required
to verify this.

12-22
=====
Some users did not realize that ``bin/install_all.sh`` was just
an example install to help system administrators.
This script has been included in the documentation and moved to
:ref:`bin/example_install.sh<example_install.sh-name>` to make this clear.

12-21
=====
Advance to using ``cppad-20171215``
which is required by ``cppad_mixed-20171218`` .

12-20
=====

#. Advance to using ``cppad_mixed-20171218`` .
   This uses the CppAD subgraph method to compute the sparsity of the Hessian
   with respect to the random effects.
   It is expected to be faster on large problems, but more testing is required
   to verify this.
#. Sometimes, new versions of the python files were not installed because the
   ``bin/setup.py`` file was not executable. This has been fixed.

12-16
=====

#. There was a mistake in the linking of the
   :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@sqlite3` and
   :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@gsl` libraries
   that caused a problem during
   :ref:`testing<install_unix@dismod_at@Test>` on some systems.
   This has been fixed.
#. The value :ref:`libdir<install_settings.py@cmake_libdir>` is now specified
   in ``bin/run_cmake.sh``
   (it used to be specified by ``bin/libdir.sh`` ).

12-13
=====
There was a bug in the
:ref:`predict sample<predict_command@source@sample>` command
when :ref:`install_settings.py@build_type` was ``debug`` .
To be specific, the check to see if the database was consistent
had an error in it.
This has been fixed.

12-10
=====

#. Move documentation from IHME to github; see

   https://bradbell.github.io/dismod_at/doc/index.html.
#. The :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@git` program
   was added to the system requirements.
#. The :ref:`download<install_unix@Download dismod_at.git>` instructions
   were changed to use ``git`` for distributing the program.

11-12
=====

#. Fix the definition of the
   :ref:`adjusted standard deviation<data_like@Adjusted Standard Deviation, sigma_i(theta)>`
   for the measurement values
   (the definition for log an linear cases is the same).
#. Fix the definition of the
   :ref:`mulcov_table@mulcov_type@meas_value` covariate multipliers
   :ref:`beta_j<avg_integrand@Measurement Value Covariates@Subgroup Measurement Covariate Multiplier, Delta beta_j>`
   and the
   :ref:`mulcov_table@mulcov_type@meas_noise` covariate multipliers
   :ref:`data_like@Measurement Noise Covariates@gamma_j (a, t)` .
   They used to be :math:`\beta_{i,j}` and :math:`\gamma_{i,j}`
   but they do not depend on the data index :math:`i`.

11-08
=====
Change the title of the :ref:`data_like-name` section and
fix minor typos in the notation for the
age upper limit :ref:`data_like@Notation@b_i` and
time upper limit :ref:`data_like@Notation@t_i` .

10-25
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20171025``
   and install it using the rev_hes_sparsity option.
#. Advance to ``cppad-20171023``
   to avoid a compiler warning.

10-24
=====
Some minor changes were made to the bilinear interpolation section.
To be more specific, some typos were fixed in
:ref:`bilinear@Function Grid` and the
:ref:`bilinear@Interpolant@Outside Both Limits`
discussions.
In addition, the :ref:`bilinear@Plotting` discussion was added.

10-22
=====

#. Add the option to specify
   :ref:`option_table@Parent Node@parent_node_name`
   instead of parent_node_id.
   The :ref:`create_database-name` routine was changed to put the parent_node_name
   in the option table, instead of mapping it to the parent_node_id.
   (Using parent_node_id avoids a lookup in the node table,
   but the time for this lookup is not expected to be significant.)
#. Fix ``create_connection`` in case where
   :ref:`create_connection@new` is true and previous version
   of the file did not exist.
   (Not sure why this did not create more failures.)

10-21
=====

#. The :ref:`depend_command-name` was added and the
   :ref:`db2csv_command@variable.csv@depend` column was
   added to the ``variable.csv`` file.
#. The Input and Output by Command paragraph
   in the :ref:`data_flow-name` page was corrected.
   To be specific :ref:`fit_data_subset_table-name` , not :ref:`data_subset_table-name` ,
   is output by the :ref:`fit_command-name` .

10-20
=====
Add the
``checkpoint_newton_step``
option to the dismod_at configuration script.
The default value in ``run_cmake.sh`` for this setting
is ``yes`` (it used to be set at ``no`` ).

10-18
=====

#. Improve documentation for following sections:
   :ref:`avg_integrand-name` ,
   :ref:`model_variables-name` ,
   :ref:`get_started_db.py-name` .
#. Add cross references from values in the
   :ref:`rate_table-name` and :ref:`integrand_table-name`
   to the corresponding average integrand notation.
#. Simplify the python code in :ref:`get_started_db.py-name` .
#. A warning about re-running the
   :ref:`set_command<set_command@option@init>` command
   was added to the set command and the
   :ref:`modify_command<modify_command@Warning>` .

10-17
=====

#. The :ref:`db2csv_command.py-name` example / test was added
   and the corresponding :ref:`wish_list-name` item was removed.
#. The :ref:`command@Log Messages` were missing
   for the :ref:`db2csv_command-name` .
   This has been fixed.
#. The empty text was sometimes placed in
   the :ref:`log_table@table_name` column of the log table.
   This was a bug and has been fixed by using ``null`` in these cases; see
   :ref:`database@Null@Text can be Null, not Empty` .
#. The ``create_connection`` routine now exist with a fatal
   error message when the specified
   :ref:`create_connection@file_name` does not exist.
#. The :ref:`modify_command-name` was added.

10-14
=====

#. Specifications were added to forbid
   :ref:`data_table@node_id@Child Data`
   from having
   :ref:`density_table@density_name@laplace` or
   :ref:`density_table@density_name@log_laplace` densities.
#. In addition, the discussion of
   :ref:`random_effects<data_like@Notation@Random Effects, u>` vector :math:`u`
   in the data likelihood model was improved.

10-13
=====

#. In the
   :ref:`db2csv_command@variable.csv` file
   replace the *sam_value* column by the
   :ref:`db2csv_command@variable.csv@sam_avg` and
   :ref:`db2csv_command@variable.csv@sam_std` columns.
#. The :ref:`simulate_command-name` has been extended to handle
   :ref:`density_table@density_name@students` and
   :ref:`density_table@density_name@log_students`
   densities in the
   :ref:`data_table@density_id` .

10-09
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20171009.

10-06
=====

#. Add the :ref:`db2csv_command@variable.csv@truth`
   column to the ``variable.csv`` file create by the
   :ref:`db2csv_command-name` .
#. Add the sample table as a possible source for the values used in the
   :ref:`set command<set_command@source@sample>` .
#. Add the fit_var and truth_var tables as a possible source for the
   predict command.
   Note that the predict command now requires the
   :ref:`predict_command@source` argument.
#. The fit_var
   :ref:`sample_command@method`
   for the sample command has been removed.
   It was no longer useful
   given the ability to specify fit_var in the :ref:`predict_command-name` .
#. In the fit table, change ``variable_value`` to
   :ref:`fit_var_table@fit_var_value` .
#. There was a problem with the install process where by the include
   directories for
   :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@sqlite3` ,
   :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@gsl` , or
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@ipopt` ,
   might not be set correctly.
   This has been fixed.

10-05
=====

#. The restrictions on the
   :ref:`rate_table@Child Value Priors` and
   :ref:`rate_table@Child Difference Priors`
   have been changed.
   To be specific, the density need not be Gaussian,
   it can be anything but Laplace and Log-Laplace.
   The user needs to be careful to ensure that the Hessian
   of the likelihood with respect to the random effects is positive definite; see
   :ref:`rate_table@child_smooth_id@Random Effects Hessian` .
#. Add specifications for
   :ref:`comment tables<database@Comment Columns and Tables>` .
#. Change the ``create_database`` so that when certain entries
   are not present, the value null is used for the corresponding
   entry in the database.
   In addition, remove the corresponding setting to ``None`` in the
   :ref:`user_example-name` examples.
#. Change ``random_bound`` to
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Random Only@bound_random` .
   Change ``zero_sum_child_rate`` to
   :ref:`option_table@Zero Sum Constraints@zero_sum_child_rate` .
   Change ``fixed_bound_frac`` to
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed Only@bound_frac_fixed` .

10-04
=====
Add the :ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Student's-t` and
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Log-Student's-t`
density functions; see ``user_students.py`` .
This required changing :ref:`density_table-name` in a way that is not backward
compatible. To be specific, the
:ref:`density_table@density_name@students` and
:ref:`density_table@density_name@log_students` rows
were added to the table.

10-02
=====

#. Change the ``create_database``
   :ref:`create_database@data_table` so that
   *meas_std* and *eta* need not appear when they are null.
   In addition, remove the null *eta* values from the
   :ref:`user_example-name` examples.
#. Reduce the chance of random
   failure in the :ref:`user_lasso_covariate.py-name` example.

10-01
=====
Simplify the weighted residual function
:ref:`R<statistic@Weighted Residual Function, R>`
and the log density function
:ref:`D<statistic@Log-Density Function, D>` .
To be specific,
the :ref:`density_table@density_id`
and :ref:`prior_table@eta` were combined into :math:`d` in the

09-30
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20170930.
This fixes a bug where the optimization of the fixed effects
was terminating (instead of backing up) when the optimization
of the random effects failed.

09-29
=====

#. The change on :ref:`2017@mm-dd@09-20`
   introduced a bug because it ignored the
   :ref:`option_table@warn_on_stderr` option.
   This has been fixed.
#. The :ref:`user_re_scale.py-name` example was added.
#. Add the :ref:`set_command@option` version of the set command.
   Changes to the option table that are done this way get recorded in the
   :ref:`log_table-name` .

09-28
=====
Add the scale_var table which enables the user
to have more control over scaling the objective. See
:ref:`scale_var_table@scale_var_value` and
:ref:`set command<set_command@table_out@scale_var>` .

09-27
=====

#. This change was merged into the master branch on 09-29.
   Remove the ``start`` command.
   It has been replace by the :ref:`set_command-name` syntax

      ``dismod_at set start_var`` *source*

#. Fix a bug in :ref:`db2csv_command-name` that occurred when
   :ref:`smooth_table@mulstd_value_prior_id`
   was not null.
#. Fix a bug in :ref:`db2csv_command-name` when
   :ref:`option_table@warn_on_stderr` was present.
#. Fix a bug in :ref:`db2csv_command-name` when
   :ref:`option_table@Extra Columns@data_extra_columns` or
   :ref:`option_table@Extra Columns@avgint_extra_columns` was
   present and null.
#. A ``db2csv`` wish list item was added (fulfilled on
   :ref:`2017@mm-dd@10-17` ).

09-26
=====
These changes were merged into the master branch on 09-29.

#. Add the :ref:`sql_command-name` python function.
#. Change :ref:`init_command-name` so that it also creates a version of the
   :ref:`start_var_table-name` using the prior means.
#. Remove the ``truth`` command.
   It has been replace by the :ref:`set_command-name` syntax

      ``dismod_at set truth_var fit_var``

09-25
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20170925 for improved error handling
and messaging.

09-23
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20170923 for improved error handling
and messaging.

09-21
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160919``
   We are working on improving error messaging when ``nan`` occurs
   during optimization.
#. Add ``susceptible`` and ``withC`` to
   the documentation for the types of average integrands
   :ref:`I_i(a,t)<avg_integrand@Integrand, I_i(a,t)>` .
   These integrands were already available, see
   :ref:`integrand_table@integrand_name` .

09-20
=====
All warnings are now printed to standard error as well as being
logged in the database.
Errors are also printed, but this is not a change.

09-19
=====

#. Some of the
   :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements`
   were not being installed in the proper place on the MAC.
   The install has been modified to use
   :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@pkg-config` to find these
   non-standard locations.
#. The ``log_fatal_error`` option was removed from :ref:`install_settings.py-name`
   (by putting an assert before the exit in the fatal error routine).

09-18
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160918`` ; see
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` .
   This provides more error messaging when nan's occur in the
   random effects objective.
#. The documentation for
   :ref:`database@Null@Bounds`
   was improved.

09-17
=====

#. There was a bug in setting the lower and upper limits of random effects
   equal that sometimes caused a ``nan`` result during ``initialize`` .
   This has been fixed.
#. Make :ref:`bilinear-name` and ``ode_grid`` separate sections
   and improve their presentations.

09-16
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160916`` ; see
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` .
This makes the optimization with respect to the random effects back
up when the object results in a ``nan`` .

09-02
=====

#. Instructions were added for building both the debug and release
   :ref:`install_settings.py@dismod_at_prefix@Debug and Release`
   version of ``dismod_at`` on the same system.
#. The :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed`
   install script was changed so that it does not optimize AD functions when
   :ref:`install_settings.py@build_type` is ``debug`` .
   This can be used to verify that optimizing to AD functions only
   affects the speed and memory used by ``dismod_at`` and
   not its results.

09-01
=====

#. Add the
   :ref:`user_speed.py@n_children` argument to the
   speed example / test.
#. Add a definition of the
   :ref:`option_table@Parent Node@Children`
   to the option table.

08-30
=====
Advance to cppad-20170830. This fixes a problem with the cmake command;
to be specific,

   ``Policy CMP0046 is not set: Error on non-existent dependency``

08-07
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20170801`` to fix an install problem where
   ``ran_obj_tst`` was not defined.
#. The postscripts ``fixed`` and ``random`` were missing from the
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@accept_after_max_steps`
   documentation.
#. It would be nice to have a sample_data_subset table that is similar to the
   :ref:`fit_data_subset_table-name` , but corresponds to
   :ref:`sample command<sample_command@simulate>`
   with *method* equal to ``data_sim`` .

05-23
=====
Advance to cppad-20170522.

05-05
=====
Improved the detection of which
:ref:`data_table-name` rows do not require the
:ref:`random effects<model_variables@Random Effects, u>`
to make correspond :ref:`avg_integrand-name` model prediction.
This may make the computation more efficient, but otherwise
the user should see no difference.

05-02
=====
The noise covariate multipliers effect
used to scale the measurement standard deviation.
Now it is directly added to the measurement standard deviation; see
:ref:`adjusted standard deviation<data_like@Adjusted Standard Deviation, sigma_i(theta)>` .
This makes the :ref:`mulcov_table@mulcov_type@meas_noise`
covariate multipliers more difficult to use because they have units.
On the other hand, it is more flexible for
use in meta-regression when the standard deviations for some measurements
is small and the difference between measurement sets is large.

05-01
=====

#. Remove recommendation for using
   ``prior_zero`` and ``prior_one`` as
   :ref:`prior names<prior_table@prior_name>` .
   These have been replace by more flexible, and easier to use
   :ref:`smooth_grid_table@const_value` ,
   and use of null as smoothing; e.g.,
   null as a *parent_smooth_id* in the
   :ref:`rate table<rate_table@parent_smooth_id>` .
#. Provide more information by splitting node into
   :ref:`db2csv_command@data.csv@child` and
   :ref:`db2csv_command@data.csv@node` in
   data.csv
#. The :ref:`get_started-name` section has been moved to the same level as
   :ref:`user_example-name` and the
   ``Commands`` heading has been added to the user section
   (it has since been removed).
#. Improve smooth_grid table
   documentation for cases and meaning when the following value are null:
   :ref:`smooth_grid_table@const_value` ,
   :ref:`smooth_grid_table@value_prior_id` ,
   :ref:`smooth_grid_table@dage_prior_id` ,
   :ref:`smooth_grid_table@dtime_prior_id` .

04-29
=====

#. The avgint_subset table has been removed.
   The avgint table is only
   :ref:`used<avgint_table@Purpose@Usage>` by the :ref:`predict_command-name` .
   As such, it can be changed, and the predict command can be re-run,
   without having to first run any other commands.
#. There was a bug and the case
   :ref:`fit fixed<fit_command@variables@fixed>` would not run
   when
   :ref:`option_table@Zero Sum Constraints@zero_sum_child_rate` was not null
   (specified one or more rates).
   This has been fixed.
#. For each *rate_name* in
   :ref:`option_table@Zero Sum Constraints@zero_sum_child_rate`
   the corresponding
   :ref:`rate_table@child_nslist_id`
   must be null.
   An error messages is reported if this is not the case.

04-27
=====
Change the :ref:`option_table@Zero Sum Constraints@zero_sum_child_rate` option
so it can select specific rates to have zero sum.
This was necessary so that
:ref:`rate_table@child_nslist_id` can be used
to use different priors for each child and some rates,
while other rates have the same prior for each child and zero sum.

04-26
=====

#. In the :ref:`user_example-name` examples,
   move the setup of
   :ref:`create_database@avgint_table`
   just before the setup of
   :ref:`create_database@data_table`
   because they are so similar.
#. The :ref:`db2csv_command@predict.csv@avgint_id` was
   added to the ``predict.csv`` file.
#. Add :ref:`option_table@Extra Columns@data_extra_columns`
   and remove ``data_name`` column from the data table.

04-25
=====

#. Advance to cppad_mixed-20170424.
#. The convergence criteria, is now relative to the derivative values
   at the mean of the prior for the fixed effects.
   This also holds for the values printed during the optimization of the
   fixed effects, see :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@print_level` .
   These values used to be relative to the
   :ref:`starting variables<start_var_table-name>` which would change
   when one continued an optimization.
#. Add the :ref:`user_continue_fit.py-name` example.
#. Add the :ref:`option_table@warn_on_stderr` option.
#. Add the :ref:`option_table@Extra Columns@avgint_extra_columns` option.

04-24
=====
Fix bug in ``dev::eigen_ode2.cpp`` where
the ``std::abs`` function was being called and ``std::fabs``
should have been called.
(This caused some tests to fail on the Mac but not on Fedora.)

04-23
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20170423, this improves the detection of
convergence of the fixed effects optimization problem, see
:ref:`fit_command-name` .

04-22
=====

#. The :ref:`init_command-name` now deletes any existing
   :ref:`output tables<data_flow@Output Tables by Table Name>` .
#. The version number in the dismod_at python package
   was stuck at ``20160516`` ; i.e., not being updated.
   This has been fixed.

04-21
=====

#. Change the name of the output section to the
   :ref:`data_flow-name` section.
#. Add the :ref:`option_table@minimum_meas_cv` option.
   This is useful because the IHME database has
   bad measurement standard deviations that are two or more orders of
   magnitude small than the corresponding measurement values.
#. Change the simulate command so only the ``log_gaussian`` and
   ``log_laplace`` negative data is set to zero.
   (It used to also do this in the ``gaussian`` and ``laplace`` cases.)

04-20
=====

#. Add a comment about
   :ref:`init_command@Changing Values` , in the input tables,
   to the ``init`` command.
#. Add more links that show how the different :ref:`model_variables-name` appear
   in the :ref:`avg_integrand-name` .
#. Correct the discussion of model variables to state that it is now
   possible to have a different smoothing for each
   :ref:`child rate effect<model_variables@Random Effects, u@Child Rate Effects>` .

04-19
=====
The offset in the log transformation for the data is now specified
in the data table (for each data point) instead of in the
integrand table (for all data points corresponding to an integrand); see
:ref:`data_table@eta` .

04-18
=====
Change the definition of adjusted standard deviation for data in the
:ref:`Gaussian and Laplace<data_like@Adjusted Standard Deviation, sigma_i(theta)>`
case (it is now different from the Log-Gaussian and Log-Laplace case).
(This has since been changed back.)

04-17
=====
Add ``random`` to possible choices for
:ref:`fit_command@variables` during the fit.

04-16
=====

#. The change on 04-15 introduced a bug whereby non-zero values for
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Random Only@bound_random` were not having
   any effects.
   This has been fixed.
#. The :ref:`fit_command@variables` argument was added to the
   fit command. It is better to use *variables* equal to ``fixed`` ,
   a apposed to changing
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Random Only@bound_random`
   in the ``option`` table.
#. The :ref:`wish_list-name` was updated.

04-15
=====
It is now possible to constrain each random effect to have a specific value;
see
:ref:`constant child value priors<rate_table@Child Value Priors@Constant>` .

04-09
=====

#. The :ref:`smooth_grid_table@const_value` option
   was added to the ``smooth_grid`` table.
   This makes it much easier to constrain a variable to
   have a specific value at a specific age and time.
#. Instructions on how to create the database
   :ref:`user_example@example.db` for a specific example,
   were added to the user example section.

04-07
=====

#. More discussion was added for how the
   :ref:`option_table@Parent Node`
   and the
   :ref:`covariate_table@max_difference`
   affect the
   :ref:`data_subset_table-name` and ``avgint_subset_table`` .
#. The :ref:`get_started-name` example was changed to use a single
   exponential model.
   In addition, the :ref:`get_started_db.py-name` example is now
   a good starting point for editing to add more complexity to the model.

04-05
=====

#. The definition of the average integrand has been changed to include the
   :ref:`measurement value covariate effect<avg_integrand@Measurement Value Covariates@Measurement Effect>` .
#. The ``bin/install_suitesparse.sh`` script has been changed to
   work on the MAC (where the ``-lrt`` library is not available).
#. The optimization tolerance in :ref:`user_group_mulcov.py-name`
   was made smaller to avoid test failures on some machines.

04-04
=====
The notation *average weight* (for :math:`\bar{w}_i`) was
corrected to be
:ref:`weight integral<avg_integrand@Weight Integral, wbar_i>` .

04-03
=====
Advance to ``cppad-20170402`` and ``cppad_mixed-20170403`` .
The Cppad change fixes a bug in the optimization of conditional expressions.
This in turn enables Cppad Mixed to make more use of AD function optimization
(and still pass all the tests in ``dismod_at`` ).

04-01
=====

#. Remove the need to set *PKG_CONFIG_PATH* during the
   :ref:`install_unix-name` procedure
   (:ref:`install_settings.py@dismod_at_prefix`
   in ``bin/run_cmake.sh`` is used to determine this setting automatically).
#. Improve the discussion on setting the
   :ref:`python path<install_unix@Paths@PYTHONPATH>` .

03-30
=====
Add ``susceptible`` and ``withC`` to the list
of possible integrand names; see
:ref:`integrand_table@integrand_name` .

03-29
=====
Advance to cppad-20170329 and cppad_mixed-20170329.

03-17
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20170317.
This includes a change to the ``cppad_mixed`` ,
but no change from the ``dismod_at`` user's perspective.

03-06
=====
Advance to
:ref:`cppad-20170306<install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad>` .
This fixes another bug in Cppad.

03-04
=====
Advance to
:ref:`cppad-20170304<install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad>` .
This fixes a bug in Cppad.
Advance to
:ref:`cppad_mixed-20170304<install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed>` .
This improves the scaling and solution check for optimization of the
fixed effects.

03-03
=====
Simplify the install procedure. Now it is only necessary to adjust
the settings in
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@install_settings.py` .
These settings are automatically used by all the
``bin/install_`` *package* . ``sh`` scripts.

01-27
=====
The values in the
:ref:`covariate<db2csv_command@predict.csv@Covariates>` columns
of the ``predict.csv`` file were not correct
(did not correspond to the :ref:`avgint_table-name` .
This has been fixed.

01-26
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20171126.
This version includes the scaling mentioned under 01-24,
but prints the original (unscaled) objective in the optimizer trace.

01-24
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20171124.
This version re-scales the problem using the derivatives values at
the starting point.
This is in addition to the
:ref:`scaling<prior_table@eta@Scaling Fixed Effects>` done using ``eta`` .

01-14
=====
The ``adaptive`` and ``trace-adaptive``
:ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@derivative_test` options
generated error messages. This has been fixed and they now work.

01-15
=====
Advance to cppad-20161113 and cppad_mixed-20170114.
