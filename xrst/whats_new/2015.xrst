Release Notes for 2015
######################

mm-dd
*****

12-29
=====

#. Advance to newer version of ``cppad`` and ``cppad_mixed`` .
#. Use new CppAD ``to_string`` utility in place off
   ``dismod_at/include/to_string.hpp`` .

12-24
=====
Advance to newer version of ``cppad_mixed``
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).
This fixed a bug in that package.

12-15
=====
Advance to newer version of ``cppad``
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad.sh`` ).
This should have been done on 12-09 when we converted to using
``cppad_mixed`` package.

12-14
=====
Advance to a newer version of ``cppad_mixed``
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).

12-10
=====
Advance to a newer version of ``cppad_mixed``
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).

12-09
=====
First version of ``dismod_at`` that has
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed`
split out as a separate package.
The following definitions are no longer used by the
:ref:`dismod_at cmake command<install_unix@dismod_at@Cmake Command>` :
``cppad_mixed_set_sparsity`` ,
``cppad_mixed_libdir`` , and
``cppad_mixed_prefix`` .

11-23
=====
The Ipopt optimizer has a bound relaxation factor that caused
dismod_at to try and evaluate its object at negative rates.
This has been fixed by setting this factor to zero.

11-22
=====

#. Move the ``fit_residual`` table to the
   :ref:`fit_data_subset_table-name` .
   This is a better name as evidenced by the fact that a
   separate ``data_subset_id`` column is no longer necessary;
   see ``dev::fit_data_subset_table::fit_data_subset_id`` .
#. Change the previous ``start_command`` to have the
   *source* argument.
   The *source* corresponding to its previous usage is
   ``prior_mean`` .
   The ``fit_var`` option
   uses the results of one fit as the starting value for the next.

11-21
=====

#. Change :ref:`create_database-name` so that it always uses ``None``
   (not empty string) when the corresponding database value is ``null`` .
   The effected the
   :ref:`create_database@smooth_table` values for
   *mulstd_value_prior_name* ,
   *mulstd_dage_prior_name* ,
   *mulstd_dtime_prior_name* .
   It also effected the
   :ref:`create_database@rate_table` values for
   *parent_smooth* , *child_smooth* .
#. The ``bin/import_cascade.py`` example now outputs its files
   in the same direction as its ``option.csv`` file,
   (instead of a subdirectory with the same name as the cascade run).
   This is because the option file is not general purpose
   and should be in a directory that is special for the particular case.
#. Created ``test/ihme/22906.py`` , a test (under construction)
   that fits ihme model number 22906.
#. Change column order in ``bin/database2csv.py`` ``data.csv``
   file so *meas_value* is next to *avgint* .
#. Make the ``prior_none`` and ``prior_zero_one`` the first
   two priors so they are easy to reference by their *prior_id* .
#. Have ``test/ihme/22906.py`` allow for jump between age 30
   and 31 (at any time).

11-20
=====

#. Improve the new derivative checker.
#. Improve ``bin/import_cascade.py`` .
#. The ``fit_command`` was using the mean for the variable values,
   instead of the values specified in :ref:`start_var_table-name` .
   This has been fixed.
#. The optimization :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@max_num_iter`
   was changed to allow for zero.
   This enables one to use the starting values in the
   :ref:`fit_var_table-name` and :ref:`fit_data_subset_table-name` tables.

11-17
=====
Add another derivative checker
``cppad_mixed ipopt_fixed_check_grad_f``
(not yet part of ``cppad_mixed`` user API).

11-16
=====
Add the :ref:`user_jump_at_age.py-name` example.

11-15
=====

#. The ``fit_var_value`` column in the fit table has been changed to
   the :ref:`fit_var_table@fit_var_value` column.
#. Add residual columns for
   :ref:`value<fit_var_table@residual_value>`
   :ref:`dage<fit_var_table@residual_dage>` and
   :ref:`dtime<fit_var_table@residual_dtime>`
   to the fit_var table.

11-14
=====
There was a bug when running models with no
:ref:`random effects<model_variables@Random Effects, u>`
because the ``cppad_mixed ran_like`` was non-empty.
This has been fixed.
In addition, the ``cppad_mixed`` sub-package now detects
when this is the case and reports the error.
Furthermore, there were some cases where the model for the data
did not depend on the random effects, but the Laplace approximation
was still being applied (correct but not efficient).
This has also been fixed.

11-12
=====

#. Add :ref:`option_table@random_seed` to the speed tests
   :ref:`user_speed.py-name` and ``cppad_mixed capture_xam.cpp`` .
#. Change the log table format for the
   :ref:`log_table@message_type@command` message type.
   In addition, improve documentation of what value
   is used for the :ref:`log_table@message_type@random_seed` .
#. There was a problem with the updating of the version number in
   ``bin/setup.py`` that could cause the
   :ref:`python install<install_unix@dismod_at@Install>` command to fail.
   This has been fixed.

11-10
=====

#. Group all of the user database documentation under the section
   :ref:`database-name`
#. Modify ``bin/import_cascade.py`` to take advantage of the
   ``null`` option for the rate
   :ref:`rate_table@parent_smooth_id` and
   *child_smooth_id* .
#. Change from text can be empty to text can be null
   (to make it more like other types); see
   :ref:`database@Null@Text can be Null, not Empty` ).
#. Implement the space saving Jacobian and Hessian calculations for the
   ``cppad_mixed fixed likelihood``
   :math:`g(\theta)`.
#. Only initialize the Hessian terms for
   fixed likelihood :math:`g(\theta)`
   and the ``cppad_mixed constraint`` function
   :math:`c(\theta)`
   when ``cppad_mixed quasi_fixed`` is false.
#. Fix transposition of correspondence between
   *age_id* , *time_id* and *var_id*
   the :ref:`var_table-name` .

11-09
=====

#. Advance to a new version of CppAD; i.e., need to rerun
   ``bin/install_cppad.sh`` .
#. Remove derivative testing from the tests in the ``speed`` directory.
   Increase the number of random effects in ``cppad_mixed capture_xam.cpp`` to
   reduce the change of false negative tests.
   Increase the number of data points in :ref:`user_speed.py-name`
   for the same reason.
   (This is reasonable because ``cppad_mixed`` is now faster and uses
   less memory.)
#. The dismod_at :ref:`python-name` module is now part of the distribution; see
   :ref:`install_unix@dismod_at@Install` .
#. Change the C++ ``dev::get_table_column.cpp`` so it will handle upper case for
   column types. In addition, if a column has an invalid type, report the
   table and column and invalid type.

11-07
=====

#. One can now inform ``dismod_at`` that a specific
   parent rate (child rate effect) is always zero by setting
   :ref:`parent_smooth_id<rate_table@parent_smooth_id@null>`
   ( :ref:`child_smooth_id<rate_table@child_smooth_id@null>` )
   to ``null`` .
   This reduces the number of :ref:`model_variables-name` .
#. The ``example/user/speed.py`` test was modified to take advantage
   of this feature.
   The memory requirement reported by massif decreased from
   21.45 MB to 12.64 MB.
   The time in Ipopt decreased from
   6.142 sec to 2.477 sec
   the time in NLP function evaluations decreased from
   16.760 to 10.321.
   The number of grid points for each of the child rate effects
   (random  effects) was then increased from one to four.
#. The random effects sub-package name was changed from
   ``mixed_cppad`` to ``cppad_mixed`` .

11-06
=====
Add lower and upper limits to the random effects in
``cppad_mixed optimize_random`` and
``cppad_mixed optimize_fixed`` .
This is represented by
:ref:`option_table@Optimize Random Only@bound_random` in the option table.

11-05
=====

#. The ``relrisk`` and ``mtwith`` integrands were not being
   computed properly.
   This has been fixed.
#. The fit results were sometimes missing from the
   ``database2csv.py`` output files (when they should have been there).
   This has been fixed.

11-04
=====

#. Add :ref:`fit_simulate_index<fit_command@simulate_index>`
   to the option table and
   change ``bin/database2csv.py`` to display simulated data
   *fit_simulate_index* is not empty.
#. Add a user example that uses *fit_simulate_index*
   to fit simulated data; see :ref:`user_fit_sim.py-name` .
#. The :ref:`sample_table-name` may be created directly to control
   the input to the :ref:`predict_command-name` .
#. One may now
   :ref:`change values<option_table@Changing Values>` in the option table
   without invalidating all of the
   :ref:`output tables<data_flow@Output Tables by Table Name>` .
#. There was a bug in the solution of the differential equation.
   The ``iota_pos_rho_zero`` and ``iota_zero_rho_pos``
   :ref:`option_table@rate_case` options were reversed.
   This bug was introduced on :ref:`2015@mm-dd@10-29`
   and has been fixed.
#. The ``cppad_mixed ran_like`` virtual
   function must be implemented for both ``a1_double`` and ``a2_double``
   (one used to only need to implement ``a2_double`` ).

11-03
=====

#. Change ``bin/database2csv.py`` to only take one argument.
#. Change all the :ref:`commands<command-name>` to have syntax

      ``dismod_at`` *file_name* *command*

   i.e., switch the order of *file_name* and *command* .

11-02
=====

#. Added the data base dump program
   ``bin/database2csv.py`` .
   This is just an example of how one might view the
   information in the database.
   It is not documented or tested and may change with time.
#. Working on improving
   ``bin/import_cascade.py`` ,
   another undocumented example that may change with time.

11-01
=====

#. The reduction in memory and increase in speed on 10-30
   did not make sense and does not seem to be reproducible
   (even using the source code check in that was intended to do so).
#. One can now use log-Gaussian and log-Laplace for the
   prior on differences for fixed effects; see fixed effects
   :ref:`age<fixed_diff@A^theta>` and
   :ref:`time<fixed_diff@T^theta>` differences.
   This required a complete re-write (and simplification) of the
   documentation for the weighted residuals and log-densities.
   In addition, the actual definitions were changed for the differences;
   see the difference version of the
   :ref:`weighted residuals<statistic@Weighted Residual Function, R>`
   and
   :ref:`log-densities<statistic@Log-Density Function, D>` .
   The corresponding wish list item has been removed.

10-30
=====

#. The notation for the
   :ref:`weighted residual<statistic@Weighted Residual Function, R>`
   and
   :ref:`log-density<statistic@Log-Density Function, D>`
   was greatly simplified by adding the
   :ref:`density<density_table-name>` as an argument.
#. The :ref:`simulated.py<user_speed.py-name>`
   speed test was changed to use the log-Gaussian instead
   of Gaussian density for the measured values.
#. A large reduction in memory, and an increase in speed,
   was accomplished by making the
   transformed standard deviation sigma_i
   depend the data and not on the :ref:`model_variables-name` .
   To be specific, ``valgrind --tool=massif`` reported the following
   reduction for the maximum memory required by ``simulated.py`` :
   *old* = 21.73 ``MB`` , *new* = 478.8 ``KB`` .
   In addition, Ipopt reported the following
   total CPU secs in NLP function evaluations:
   *old*  = 12.98 , *new*  = 8.724 .

10-29
=====

#. The change on :ref:`2015@mm-dd@10-27` whereby
   ``node_rate_value_info`` was reverted because it used three times
   as much memory and time.
   The name was however changed from ``node_rate_value_info`` to
   :ref:`option_table@rate_case` to avoid confusion with
   ``dev::pack_info_node_rate.cpp`` .
   In addition, the correction of the bug in ``dev::eigen_ode2.cpp``
   was retained.
#. It is now an error if the value ``nan`` appears in the database;
   see :ref:`real cannot be nan<database@Null@Real Can be Null, not Nan>` .
#. Add tracing, during CppAD's forward mode, of values in the
   ``dev::residual_density.cpp`` function that should not be negative.
   This gives feedback as to the cause of CppAD's message that
   a forward mode result is ``nan`` .
#. Add a :ref:`wish_list-name` item.

10-28
=====

#. Advance to a newer version of CppAD. The requires that you re-run
   ::

      bin/install_cppad.sh

#. Remove some unused code in the dismod_at
   :ref:`user_example-name` examples (used for return value in
   :ref:`get_started_db.py-name` ).
   In addition, simply setting of the standard deviation multipliers
   to one (in the dismod_at :ref:`user_example-name` examples).
#. Add a :ref:`simulated data<user_speed.py-name>` example
   that also serves as a dismod_at speed test (the size of the problem
   can be easily scaled up).
#. The dismod_at and cppad_mixed speed tests were placed in the
   ``speed`` directory.
   They are now run separately from the correctness tests with the command
   ::

      make speed

   See instructions for running the
   :ref:`tests<install_unix@dismod_at@Test>` .

10-27
=====

#. The values in the :ref:`prior_table-name` were checked to make sure that
   *lower* <= *mean* <= *upper* ,
   except for the uniform density case *std*  > 0 ,
   and in the log density cases *eta* is not null.
#. There was a bug in the ``dev::eigen_ode2.cpp`` routine whereby
   ``nan`` could result even if the rates satisfied their prescribed
   conditions. This has been fixed.
#. Modify ``dev::eigen_ode2.cpp`` so that it works for all combinations of rates
   and remove ``node_rate_value_info`` from the :ref:`option_table-name` .
   Note that this is different from ``dev::pack_info_node_rate.cpp``
   (which is only in the developer documentation).

10-26
=====
Changed the specification for the :ref:`create_database-name` argument
:ref:`create_database@option_table` .
To be specific, the row

   { ``'name'`` : ``'parent_node_id'`` , ``'value'`` :' *parent_node_id* ' }

was replace by the row

   { ``'name'`` : ``'parent_node_name'`` , ``'value'`` :' *parent_node_name* ' }

10-25
=====

#. Make the choice between quasi-Newton and full Newton
   a program option for the ``cppad_mixed`` package; see
   ``cppad_mixed quasi_fixed`` .
#. The option to choose between quasi-Newton and full Newton
   for the fixed effects optimization was moved into the options table; see
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed Only@quasi_fixed` .

10-24
=====

#. Reduce the probability of the
   ``test/cppad_mixed/binomial.cpp`` test failed by chance
   during :ref:`testing<install_unix@dismod_at@Test>` .
#. The ``cppad_mixed optimize_fixed`` effects
   procedure can now uses a BFGS method (and requires much less memory).
   The *cppad_mixed_newton* option in the
   :ref:`install_unix@dismod_at@Setup`
   can be used to select the old Newton method.
#. The
   ``cppad_mixed_set_sparsity`` option was also added to the
   :ref:`install_unix@dismod_at@Setup` .
#. Create a separate documentation section for editing of
   :ref:`install_settings.py-name` during the install procedure.

10-20
=====

#. The ``approx_mixed`` sub-package name was changed to
   ``cppad_mixed`` . In addition example names of the form
   ``approx_`` *name* where changed to ``mixed_`` *name* ; e.g.,
   ``cppad_mixed mixed_derived`` .
#. The ``cppad_mixed_eigen`` library was not being installed
   and the ``bin/check_cppad_mixed.sh`` test failed.
   This has been fixed.

10-19
=====
Added an example that demonstrates that the random effects variance
term may cause the solution to move from an exact match with the
data values; see ``cppad_mixed data_mismatch_xam.cpp`` .

10-16
=====
Two new tests were added to check cases where the solution
for the random effects should be zero; see
``test/devel/cppad_mixed/zero_random.cpp`` and
``test/user/zero_random.py`` .

10-15
=====

#. The instructions in :ref:`install_unix-name` were modified to make it clear
   that the external package installers only need to be run once; see
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements` .
#. A separate ``cppad_mixed ipopt_options`` was added for the random effect in
   ``cppad_mixed optimize_random`` and
   ``cppad_mixed optimize_fixed`` .
#. The splitting of the optimization options between fixed and random
   effects was extend to the dismod_at API;
   see :ref:`optimizer options<option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random>` .
#. Advance to a newer version of CppAD (to avoid another bug)
   and hence requires ``bin/install_cppad.sh`` to be re-run.

10-14
=====
Use full numerical precision when converting double precision values to strings
for writing to :ref:`output tables<data_flow@Output Tables by Table Name>`
(it used to be that only about six digits of precision were preserved).

09-18
=====
There was an error in the :ref:`user_no_children.py-name` example
(the parent node was ``world`` and should have been ``canada`` ).
This has been fixed.
In addition, the fitted values are now checked at the end of the example
(so that in the future, this type of mistake will be automatically detected).

09-03
=====

#. Advance to a newer version of CppAD
   (to avoid a bug when used with c++98 compilers)
   and hence requires ``bin/install_cppad.sh`` to be re-run.
#. The ``cppad_mixed newton_step`` function was not taking advantage
   of the recent memory saving changes to CppAD
   (using ``bool_sparsity_enum`` instead of ``pack_sparsity_enum`` ).
   This has been fixed.
#. The ``cppad_mixed newton_step`` was being recorded, but not used,
   and hence more memory was used, instead of memory being saved.
   This has been fixed.
#. Reduce the chance of a false failure from
   ``example/devel/cppad_mixed/user/capture_xam.cpp``
   (takes longer to run).
#. Print result of test for C++ ``nullptr`` during
   :ref:`install_unix@dismod_at@Cmake Command`

08-31
=====
Reduce memory required by ``cppad_mixed`` sub-package.
This required some recent improvements to CppAD and hence requires
``bin/install_cppad.sh`` to be re-run.

08-27
=====
Reduce the chance of a false failure from
``example/devel/cppad_mixed/user/capture_xam.cpp``
(takes longer to run).

08-21
=====

#. Edit discussion of text can be empty
   (now it must be ``null`` instead of empty) see
   :ref:`database@Null@Text can be Null, not Empty` ).
#. Remove the special prior that is a constant one from the
   :ref:`user_example-name` examples (since 08-12 ``null`` can be used to
   the same effect for
   :ref:`standard deviation multipliers<model_variables@Fixed Effects, theta@Smoothing Standard Deviation Multipliers, lambda>` ).

08-18
=====

#. There was a problem with the eigen
   install script and its use of the ``-i`` flag on Mac systems.
   This has been fixed.
#. Suppress certain warnings that occur when compiling with eigen package
   (need to be fixed by that package).
   This now requires linking both the ``cppad_mixed`` and
   ``cppad_mixed_eigen`` libraries.

08-15
=====

#. Improve the ``cppad_mixed theory`` section.
#. Add diagnostics as to the size of the ``cppad_mixed`` problem
   representation; see ``cppad_mixed size_map`` .

08-14
=====

#. Change the name of the ``avg_case_table`` to :ref:`avgint_table-name` .
#. Change all covariate value storage to be a vector separate from the
   corresponding :ref:`data_table-name` or :ref:`avgint_table-name` value storage.
   (see speed comment for ``08-13`` below).

08-13
=====
The covariate values storage was changed from a vector for each data row
to one vector for all the data rows.
For an example with 77,288 rows of data this changed to time to read
the entire database from 334 seconds to one second.

08-12
=====

#. The ``var_command`` was changed back to the :ref:`init_command-name`
   (because it creates more than just the :ref:`var_table-name` ).
#. There was a bug whereby the
   :ref:`standard deviation multipliers<model_variables@Fixed Effects, theta@Smoothing Standard Deviation Multipliers, lambda>`
   were not being used.
   This has been fixed.
#. Use ``null`` for a standard deviation multiplier now
   eliminates it from the list of variables; see :ref:`smooth_table-name` .

08-09
=====

#. There was a bug in the ``var_command`` when there were
   :ref:`covariate multipliers<mulcov_table-name>` for multiple integrands
   or multiple rates.
   This has been fixed and is tested by the user example
   ``meas_covariate.py`` .
#. The routine ``dev::data_subset.cpp`` was changes to pre-allocate its
   result instead of growing the vector as needed.
   This resulted in a huge savings (in one test case a 24 minute
   run time was reduced to 3.5 minutes).
#. The ``dev::get_db_input.cpp`` routine now checks the lower and upper limits
   implied by the choice of ``node_rate_value_info`` .
   This was removed on :ref:`2015-10-27<2015@mm-dd@10-27>` .

08-08
=====

#. Change the :ref:`init_command-name` to the ``var_command``
   (because it creates the :ref:`var_table-name` ).
#. Change the measurement covariate multiple type ``rate_mean`` to
   :ref:`mulcov_table@mulcov_type@rate_value` .
#. Simplify the ``node_rate_value_info`` choice in the
   option table.
#. Fix :ref:`logging<log_table-name>` an error message that has the
   single quote character ``'`` in it.
#. Improve the ``usage`` message that is printed when ``dismod_at``
   is executed with no command arguments.
#. Improve the error message when the :ref:`mulcov_table-name` has an invalid
   value in the ``mulcov_type`` column.
#. Reduce the chance of a false failure from
   ``test/binomial_test.cpp`` .

08-04
=====
Some compiler errors (on older compilers) were added.
In addition, the minimal version of
:ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@sqlite3` was specified.

08-03
=====

#. First version that actually installs the ``cppad_mixed`` sub-package
   using the ``cppad_mixed_libdir`` option to the
   :ref:`install_unix@dismod_at@Cmake Command` .
#. The ``cmake command`` script was not using ``bash`` as its shell
   for all systems. This has been fixed.
#. Reduce the chance of random failure in ``test/devel/n_mixture.cpp``
   (using more simulated data).

08-02
=====

#. Remove the option to include Laplace likelihoods (absolute value terms)
   in the ``cppad_mixed random negative log likelihood`` .
   This reduces the number of necessary recordings and corresponding memory.
#. The ``cppad_mixed ran_like`` function was changed from
   use ``a3_double`` objects to ``a2_double`` objects.
#. Add the ``cppad_mixed capture_xam.cpp`` example and test.
   This is both a correctness and speed test.

08-01
=====

#. The Hessian w.r.t. :math:`\beta`,

   .. math::

      H^{(2)}_\beta H( \beta, \theta, u)

   is no longer recorded as a separate AD function, but is rather
   evaluated using the recording for :math:`H( \beta , \theta , u)`
   (instead of its own separate recording.
   The greatly reduced the program memory requirements.
#. The ``cppad_mixed ran_like`` function was changed from
   use ``a5_double`` objects to ``a3_double`` objects.

07-29
=====

#. The term
   'prior negative log-likelihood' was change to
   ``cppad_mixed fixed likelihood``
   ``Fixed Likelihood, g(theta)``
   ``/`` .
#. The term
   'joint negative log-likelihood' was change to
   ``cppad_mixed random likelihood``
   ``Random Likelihood, f(theta, u)``
   ``/`` .

07-28
=====

#. Some example were missing, or were including the wrong source code.
   This has been fixed in the following user examples:
   ``cppad_mixed no_random_xam.cpp`` ,
   :ref:`create_database.py-name` .
   It was also fixed for the following developer examples:
   ``dev::avgint_subset_xam.cpp.cpp`` ,
   ``dev::subset_data_xam.cpp.cpp`` .
#. Handle the case where the
   ``cppad_mixed fix_like`` is empty.

07-27
=====
Grouped all the user level ``cppad_mixed`` examples in the
section ``cppad_mixed user`` .

07-25
=====
Add the ``dev::cpp_create_table.cpp`` routine,
and replace all uses of ``dev::put_table_row.cpp`` by ``create_table``
(much faster).

07-24
=====

#. Add the :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@derivative_test`
   option (because it is to slow to do all the time).
#. Fix the automatic setting of the number of age and time points in the
   ode_grid.

07-23
=====

#. Add the :ref:`user_lasso_covariate.py-name` example / test.
#. Fix some bugs related to using ``laplace`` and ``log_laplace``
   :ref:`densities<density_table-name>` .
#. Detect and report an error in the data table when
   :ref:`data_table@meas_std` is less than or equal zero
   and when
   :ref:`data_table@density_id` corresponds to a
   uniform distribution.

07-22
=====

#. Add the :ref:`user_no_children.py-name` example.
#. Exit with an error if
   ``cppad_mixed optimize_random`` is called
   in a case where there are no random effects.
#. There was a bug in the case where the second derivative
   of the random part of the objective
   :math:`H( \beta , \theta, u)`
   with respect to :math:`\beta` was zero.
   This has been fixed.
#. The data corresponding to the
   :ref:`option_table@Parent Node` is now in represented using
   ``cppad_mixed p(z | theta)`` instead of
   ``cppad_mixed p(y | theta, u)`` .
   This speeds up the computation and enables one to use
   Laplace and Log-Laplace likelihoods for this data
   (with out affecting the Laplace approximation for the integral).

07-21
=====
The ``cppad_mixed`` sub-package was extended to work in the case
were there are
``cppad_mixed no random effects`` .

07-20
=====

#. If :ref:`option_table@random_seed` is zero,
   use the :ref:`log_table@unix_time` in the log table
   for the random seed.
#. Remove the ``value``
   :ref:`log_table@message_type` from the ``log`` table
   (not yet necessary due to change above).
#. Simplify the :ref:`log_table@message_type@command` start
   and done messages.
#. Include data that is independent of the random effects
   ``cppad_mixed z``
   in the discussion of the ``cppad_mixed``
   ``cppad_mixed problem`` .
   Also fix a :math:`\B{p} ( y , \theta )` that was written as
   :math:`\B{p} ( y | \theta )` in the problem discussion.

07-19
=====

#. The name of the ``argument_table`` was change to the :ref:`option_table-name` .
   Some bugs were fixed in the
   ``cppad_mixed constraint`` option.
#. The :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@print_level` option
   was added to control tracing during optimization,
   use no tracing (zero) as default.
#. There was a bug in the values of :ref:`var_table@age_id`
   and :ref:`var_table@time_id` in the ``var`` table.
   This has been fixed.
#. Change the definition of
   :ref:`smooth_grid_table@dage_prior_id` and
   :ref:`smooth_grid_table@dtime_prior_id` so that
   they refer to differences and not difference quotients
   because differences are simpler.
#. The :ref:`user_diff_constraint.py-name` example was added to documentation
   and test suite.
#. The ``solution check failed`` warning would sometimes print
   incorrectly when a fixed effect was at its lower or upper bound.
   This has been fixed.

07-17
=====

#. First version of the ``cppad_mixed`` sub-package that works with
   ``cppad_mixed constraints`` ; e.g., see
   ``cppad_mixed mixed_constraint_xam.cpp`` .
#. The ``solution check failed`` warning was printing
   when the check actually passed (since 07-15).
   This has been fixed.
#. Add the ``value``
   message type to the log table
   (it has since been removed).

07-16
=====
In the ``cppad_mixed`` sub-package,
changed ``joint_density`` to
``cppad_mixed ran_like``
and changed ``prior_density`` to
``cppad_mixed fix_like`` .

07-15
=====

#. Change :ref:`create_database-name` arguments to end in _ *dict* when
   they are a list of dictionaries, so similar to
   :ref:`get_table_dict@table_dict` .
#. When writing to standard error,
   add ``Error:`` (``Warning:`` )
   to beginning of error messages (warning messages).
#. The :ref:`init_command-name` no longer deletes the current
   fit, fit_data_subset, truth_var, simulate, sample and predict tables.
   These table get overwritten when the corresponding command is executed;
   see :ref:`output tables<data_flow@Output Tables by Table Name>` .

07-14
=====

#. Add :ref:`data_table@hold_out` to the data table
   and exclude the flagged data during the :ref:`fit_command-name` .
#. Add the :ref:`fit_data_subset_table-name`
   and compute it during a :ref:`fit_command-name` .

07-13
=====

#. Record the start of and end of each :ref:`command-name` in the
   :ref:`log_table-name` .
#. Once there is a database
   ``dev::open_connection`` ,
   use :ref:`log_table-name` to record all error messages before exiting.
#. The pure virtual function
   ``cppad_mixed fatal_error``
   was added to the ``cppad_mixed`` derived class.
   This enabled ``dismod_at`` to log the ``cppad_mixed`` error messages.

07-11
=====

#. Add an error message when the text value in a table is empty; see
   :ref:`database@Null@Text can be Null, not Empty` .
   Allow for ``null`` integer values; see
   :ref:`database@Null@Integer` .
#. The example ``dev::sim_random_xam.cpp.cpp`` was missing from documentation.
   Increase *sample_size* in ``sim_random_xam.cpp``
   (to reduce change of random failure).
   In addition, print random seed when test does fail.
#. Use ``null`` instead of ``-1`` in the following cases:
   There is no :ref:`node_table@parent` node,
   there is no :ref:`smooth_grid_table@dage_prior_id` ,
   there is no :ref:`smooth_grid_table@dtime_prior_id` .
#. Add the constraint that a :ref:`database@Foreign Key`
   must appear in the corresponding primary key column,
   or it must be ``null`` .

07-10
=====

#. First version of :ref:`predict_command-name` that passes its
   example / test :ref:`predict_command.py-name` .
#. List addition input and output tables in :ref:`data_flow-name` section.

07-09
=====

#. The ``sample`` table column ``sample_value``
   was changed to :ref:`sample_table@var_value` .
#. The :ref:`avgint_table-name` was added to the set of
   :ref:`input-name` tables.
#. The ``avgint_subset_table`` was added as an output
   of the :ref:`init_command-name` .

07-08
=====

#. Change the ``var_command`` to :ref:`init_command-name`
   and use this command to initialize output tables whenever
   the :ref:`input-name` tables change.
#. Add the :ref:`data_subset_table-name` .

07-07
=====
First version of :ref:`sample_command-name` that passes its example / test.

07-05
=====

#. First version of the :ref:`simulate_command-name` that passes
   its example / test.
#. Put the :ref:`command-name` arguments in the ``argument_table``
   instead of on the command line (except for the file name of the database).
#. During :ref:`install_unix-name` ,
   there was a problem running ``make check`` without first running
   ``make`` .
   This has been fixed.
#. Use a ``var_command`` to create the :ref:`var_table-name`
   and put the :ref:`fit_command-name` results in a separate :ref:`fit_var_table-name` .

07-04
=====

#. Remove the python ``pack_info`` class
   (no longer necessary now that :ref:`var_table-name` has more information).
#. Move the ``get_started.py`` example to :ref:`fit_command.py-name` .
#. Modify the :ref:`fit_command.py-name` example so that it demonstrates
   how to use the new :ref:`var_table-name` information
   and so that it can be run as is (without configuration).

07-03
=====

#. Remove the ``variable_name`` from the :ref:`var_table-name` ,
   add extra columns to specify the exact variable using
   :ref:`foreign keys<database@Foreign Key>` .
#. Change the ``mean_mean`` covariate multiplier type to
   :ref:`mulcov_table@mulcov_type@meas_value` .
#. For *cov_type* equal ``rate_value`` , ``meas_value`` ,
   and ``meas_std`` , change

   | |tab| *cov_type* _ ``mulcov_n_cov -> mulcov_`` *cov_type* _ ``n_cov``
   | |tab| *cov_type* _ ``mulcov_info -> mulcov_`` *cov_type* _ ``info``

   see
   :ref:`var_table@var_type@mulcov_rate_value` ,
   :ref:`var_table@var_type@mulcov_meas_value` and
   :ref:`var_table@var_type@mulcov_meas_noise` .

07-01
=====

#. Simulating random numbers
   (for the :ref:`simulate_command-name` which is not yet working)
   has added the gnu scientific library
   :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@gsl`
   the system requirements.
#. The :ref:`database@Foreign Key` convention
   was added to the documentation.

06-30
=====

#. The python routine ``create_table`` now adds the
   :ref:`create_table@col_name@unique` constraint to
   :ref:`name columns<database@Name Column>` .
   This in turn is used by, and does the same for, ``create_database`` .
   In addition, the C++ examples for ``dev::devel_table``
   were changed to include constraints; e.g.,
   ``dev::get_integrand_table_xam.cpp.cpp`` .
#. There was a bug in reading the data tables whereby the following error
   would be incorrectly generated:

   | |tab| *table_name* _ ``id must start at zero and increment by one.``
   | |tab| ``Detected in`` *table_name* ``table at`` *table_name* _ ``id`` = *index* .

   where *table_name* is any table name.
   This has been fixed.
#. Added the :ref:`simulate_command-name` (not yet working).
#. The values *n_age_ode* and *n_time_ode*
   are now computed automatically
   have been removed from the :ref:`fit_command-name` argument list.
#. It is no longer necessary to run a separate
   ``make`` command to build the dismod_at executable and library
   when :ref:`installing<install_unix@dismod_at@Install>` dismod_at.
   In addition, running the :ref:`tests<install_unix@dismod_at@Test>`
   is now optional.

06-29
=====

#. Add the ``node_rate_value_info`` argument
   to the fit command.
   (This was removed on :ref:`2015-10-27<2015@mm-dd@10-27>` .)
   This enables taking advantage of cases where *rho*
   or *iota* are zero (to speed integration).
   In addition, it allows for some cases where *chi* is zero.
#. Add a simple introduction to the Dismod_at
   :ref:`avg_integrand@Ordinary Differential Equation`
#. Create links from the index (and search) to the :ref:`rates<rate_table-name>` .
   In addition, make the definition of the rates more precise; e.g.,
   see :ref:`rate_table@rate_name@iota` .
#. The :ref:`integrand_table@integrand_name`
   ``incidence`` has been changes to ``Sincidence`` to
   emphasize that it is relative to the susceptible population.
   In addition the new integrand ``Tincidence`` has been
   added (which is relative to the total population).

06-27
=====

#. All of the :ref:`prior_table@prior_id` columns in
   the :ref:`smooth_table-name` have been changed to end in ``_prior_id`` .
   To be explicit, the following column names have been changed:

   .. csv-table::
      :widths: auto

      Old name,New name
      ``mulcov_value``,``mulcov_value_prior_id``
      ``mulcov_dage``,``mulcov_dage_prior_id``
      ``mulcov_dtime``,``mulcov_dtime_prior_id``

#. Update the :ref:`wish_list-name`

06-26
=====

#. Remove the requirement that the
   :ref:`age_table@age` and :ref:`time_table@time`
   values must be in increasing order in the corresponding tables.
#. The :ref:`install<install_unix-name>` instructions have been improved.
#. There was a bug in the ``dev::weight_info.cpp`` constructor
   when the ages or times were not increasing.
   This was fixed and a second version for this date was created.

06-25
=====

#. Change ``variable_name``
   for measurement covariate and rate covariate multipliers
   from empty string to a descriptive name.
   (This column of the var table was later removed.)
#. The C++11 ``nullptr`` feature was not being suppressed
   when using a compiler that does not support this feature.
   This has been fixed.
#. There were some non-standard references,
   in ``dev::open_connection.cpp`` ,
   ``cppad_mixed ipopt_xam`` , and
   ``dev::get_column_max_xam.cpp.cpp`` ,
   that gave compiler errors on some systems.
   This has been fixed.
#. The particular settings for installing on the IHME cluster
   have been included as comments under the install dismod_at
   :ref:`install_unix@dismod_at@Setup` heading.

06-24
=====

#. There was a bug in the :ref:`create_database-name` routine,
   to be specific, it was not calling ``commit`` and ``close``
   at the end; see
   `python sqlite <https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html>`_.
#. Also close the connection at the end of each of the python sqlite examples;
   e.g., at the end of :ref:`age_table.py-name` .
#. Change ``variable_name``
   for the smoothing standard deviation multipliers
   from empty string to a descriptive name.
   (This column of the var table was later removed.)

06-23
=====
The :ref:`fit_command-name` was changed so that there can only be
on set of results in the data base.
This changed the contents of the
``fit_arg_table`` and the :ref:`var_table-name` .

06-22
=====
First version of ``dismod_at`` is available to be downloaded and installed;
see :ref:`install_unix-name` .
