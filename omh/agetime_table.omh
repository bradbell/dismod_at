$section Age-Time Tables$$

$head Definition$$
The table $icode mytable$$ is a age-time table
if it has the following columns:
$icode%mytable%_id%$$,
$code grid_id$$,
$code age$$, and 
$code time$$.
Note that a age-time table is also a 
$cref lookup_table$$.

$head mytable_id$$
The column with name $icode%mytable%_id%$$
has type $code integer$$ and is the primary key for the table.

$head grid_id$$ 
This column has type $code integer$$ and its value in a row is the 
$icode grid_id$$, in the $cref/grid/lookup_table/Lookup Only/grid/$$
table that identifies the grid for this row. 

$head age$$
The column with name $code age$$ 
has type $code real$$ and is value is the age value for this grid point.

$head time$$
The column with name $code time$$ 
has type $code real$$ and is value is the time value for this grid point.
The age and time columns must use the same units.

$head Rectangular Grid$$
Each fixed value for $icode grid_id$$ corresponds to a rectangular grid.
There are $latex m \times n$$ such rows and the corresponding 
$codei%(%time%, %age%)%$$ values are $latex ( t_i , a_j )$$ where:

$subhead n$$
is the number of values that appear in the $code age$$ column
with the specified  $icode grid_id$$.   

$subhead a_j$$
for $latex j = 1 , \ldots , n$$,
$latex a_j$$ is the $th j$$ age value,
with the specified  $icode grid_id$$, in increasing order.

$subhead m$$
is the number of values that appear in the $code time$$ column
with the specified  $icode grid_id$$.   

$subhead t_i$$
for $latex i = 1 , \ldots , m$$,
$latex t_i$$ is the $th i$$ time value,
with the specified  $icode grid_id$$, in increasing order.
