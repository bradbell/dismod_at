$section The Simulate Table$$
The $code simulate_arg$$ table is created during a
$cref simulate_command$$ and records its arguments.
It has the following columns:

$head simulate_arg_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and is the primary key for this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

$head simulate_arg_name$$
This column has type $code text$$ and is
the name for the corresponding argument to the simulate command;
i.e.,
$cref/file_name/simulate_command/file_name/$$, ...
$cref/rate_info/simulate_command/rate_info/$$.
In addition a row with $icode simulate_arg_name$$ equal to
$code actual_seed$$ is included.
This contains the actual random number generated seed and is
different from $cref/random_seed/simulate_command/random_seed/$$
when $icode random_seed$$ is zero.

$head simulate_arg_value$$
This column has type $code text$$ and is
the value for the corresponding argument to the simulate command.

$head Example$$
2DO: add an example and test for the simulate command.
