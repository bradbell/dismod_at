$section The Prior Table$$
The $code prior$$ table is used to define 
priors for a single scalar value.
It has the following columns:

$head prior_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and is the primary key for this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

$subhead zero$$
It is suggested that 
$icode%prior_id% == 0%$$ 
correspond to lower and upper limits being zero.

$subhead one$$
It is suggested that 
$icode%prior_id% == 1%$$ 
correspond to lower and upper limits being one.

$head prior_name$$
This column has type $code text$$ and has a different value for every row; 
i.e., the names are unique and can act as substitutes for the primary key.
The names are intended to be easier for a human to remember than the ids.

$head density_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and its value is the
$cref density_table$$ primary key that identifies the
density function for this prior.

$head lower$$
$index lower, minus infinity$$
$index infinity, minus lower$$
This column has type $code real$$ and specifies a lower bound
for the prior.
Note that the value $code null$$ is interpreted as minus infinity; i.e.,
no lower limit.

$head upper$$
$index upper, plus infinity$$
$index infinity, plus upper$$
This column has type $code real$$ and specifies a upper bound
for the prior.
Note that the value $code null$$ is interpreted as plus infinity; i.e.,
no upper limit.

$head mean$$
$index std, plus infinity$$
$index infinity, plus std$$
This column has type $code real$$ and specifies the mean
(before truncation by the lower and upper limits)
for the prior.
It must hold that
$codei%
	%lower% <= %mean% <= %upper%
%$$

$head std$$
$index std$$
This column has type $code real$$ and specifies the standard deviation
(before truncation by the lower and upper limits)
for the prior.
In the case where $icode density$$ is $code uniform$$,
this value is not used and can be $code null$$.
Otherwise, this value must be a positive number.

$head eta$$
This column has type $code real$$ and is only used in the
cases where $icode density$$ is $code log_gaussian$$
or $code log_laplace$$.
In these cases, it is the offset in the corresponding log transformation.
In the case where $code density$$ is 
$code uniform$$, $code gaussian$$ or $code laplace$$,
this field is not used and can be $code null$$.
