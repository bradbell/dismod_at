$section The Smoothing Grid Table$$
This table specifies smoothings for functions of age and time.
It has the following columns:

$head smooth_grid_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and is the primary key for
the $code smooth_grid$$ table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

$head smooth_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and is the primary key for
the $cref smooth_table$$.
Each value $icode smooth_id$$ corresponds to a different smoothing.

$head age_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and is a
$cref/age_id/age_table/age_id/$$ in the age table.
Each $icode age_id$$ value corresponds to a specific age.

$head time_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and is a
$cref/time_id/time_table/time_id/$$ in the time table.
Each $icode time_id$$ value corresponds to a specific time.

$head value_like_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and its value in a row is the
$cref/like_id/like_table/like_id/$$ for
the function values for this smoothing, age, and time.

$head dage_like_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and its value in a row is the
$cref/like_id/like_table/like_id/$$ for
function's forward difference quotients w.r.t age,
for this smoothing, age, and time.
The likelihood at the maximum age, for each time, is not used and
the corresponding $icode dage_like_id$$ must be $code -1$$.

$head dtime_like_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and its value in a row is the
$cref/like_id/like_table/like_id/$$ for
function's forward difference quotients w.r.t time,
for this smoothing, age, and time.
The likelihood at the maximum time, for each age, is not used and
the corresponding $icode dtime_like_id$$ must be $code -1$$.

$head Rectangular Grid$$
For each fixed value of $icode smooth_id$$ 
the set of $icode%age_id$$, $icode time_id$$ pairs is rectangular.
In other words,
if an $icode age_id$$ value appears,
it appears once with each $icode time_id$$ 
that appears with this $icode smooth_id$$.
This also means,
if a $icode time_id$$ value appears,
it appears once with each $icode age_id$$ 
that appears with this $icode smooth_id$$.

contain example $code smooth$$ tables.
