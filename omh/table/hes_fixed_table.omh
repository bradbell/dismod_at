$section Hessian of The Fixed Effect Objective Function$$

$head Creation$$
A new version of this table is created each time the
$cref/asymptotic/sample_command/method/asymptotic/$$
sample command is executed.

$head Representation$$
Only the lower triangle of the Hessian is included
(because the Hessian is symmetric).
In addition, this is a sparse representation; i.e.,
if a pair of row and column indices in the lower triangle
are not present, the Hessian is zero for that row and column pair.
The $cref/Laplace/density_table/density_name/laplace/$$ densities
are not included in the Hessian
because the Laplace density is not differentiable at zero.
None of the constraints are included in the calculation of this Hessian.

$head hes_fixed_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and is the primary key for
the this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

$head row_var_id$$
This is the $cref/var_id/var_table/var_id/$$
for the row of the Hessian that this element corresponds to.

$head col_var_id$$
This is the $cref/var_id/var_table/var_id/$$
for the column of the Hessian that this element corresponds to.

$head hes_fixed_value$$
This column has type $code real$$ and is the value of the second derivative
of the fixed effects objective w.r.t. the two
$cref/fixed effects/model_variables/Fixed Effects, theta/$$
specified by the row and column indices above.
Note that the row and column indices are equal for the diagonal
elements of the Hessian.
