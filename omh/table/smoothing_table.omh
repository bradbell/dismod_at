$section The Smoothing Table$$
This table specifies the smoothing prior for a function of age and time.
The $code smoothing$$ table is a $cref grid_table$$.
Hence it has the standard columns
$code smoothing_primary$$,
$code smoothing_id$$,
$code age$$,
$code time$$.
In addition, it has the other columns listed below:

$head smoothing_primary$$
See $cref/grid_primary/grid_table/Table grid/grid_primary/$$.

$head smoothing_id$$
See $cref/grid_id/grid_table/Table grid/grid_id/$$.

$head age$$
See $cref/age/grid_table/Table grid/age/$$.

$head time$$
See $cref/time/grid_table/Table grid/time/$$.

$head value_like_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and its value in a row is the
$icode like_id$$, in the $cref like_table$$,
for the prior that is used for the 
function value this $icode age$$ and $icode time$$.

$head dage_like_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and its value in a row is the
$icode like_id$$, in the $cref like_table$$,
for the prior that is used for the 
function's forward difference quotients w.r.t age. 
The likelihood at the maximum age, for each time, is not used.

$head dtime_like_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and its value in a row is the
$icode like_id$$, in the $cref like_table$$,
for the prior that is used for the 
function's forward difference quotients w.r.t time. 
The likelihood at the maximum time, for each age, is not used.
