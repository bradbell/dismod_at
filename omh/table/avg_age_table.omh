$section The Average Age Grid$$

$head Creation$$
This table changes each time the
$cref/ode_step_size/option_table/ode_step_size/$$ or the
$cref/avg_age_split/option_table/avg_age_split/$$ changes.
These value can change without having to re-execute the
$cref init_command$$.
For this reason, this table is re-written for each command
with the exception of the following commands:
$cref/set/set_command/$$,
$cref/db2csv/db2csv_command/$$,
$cref/csv2db/csv2db_command/$$,
and
$cref/modify/modify_command/$$.

$head avg_age_id$$
This column has type $code integer$$ and is the primary key for
the this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

$head age$$
This column has type $code real$$ and is a monotone
increasing values in the
$cref/average age grid/option_table/avg_age_split/Average Age Grid/$$
The values are unique; i.e.,
none of the values are repeated.
