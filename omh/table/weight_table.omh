$code age$$,
$code time$$.
In addition, it has the other columns listed below:

$head weight_primary$$
See $cref/grid_primary/grid_table/Table grid/grid_primary/$$.

$head weight_id$$
See $cref/grid_id/grid_table/Table grid/grid_id/$$.

$head age$$
See $cref/age/grid_table/Table grid/age/$$.

$head time$$
See $cref/time/grid_table/Table grid/time/$$.

$head weight$$
This column has type $code real$$.
For each row in the table, the value in this column
is the weighting, at the corresponding age and time,
and for the specified $icode weight_id$$,
