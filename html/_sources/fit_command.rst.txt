The Fit Command
###############

Syntax
******

| ``dismod_at`` *database* ``fit`` *variables*
| ``dismod_at`` *database* ``fit`` *variables* *simulate_index*
| ``dismod_at`` *database* ``fit`` *variables* ``warm_start``
| ``dismod_at`` *database* ``fit`` *variables* *simulate_index* ``warm_start``

database
********
Is an
http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite/ database containing the
``dismod_at`` :ref:`input-name` tables which are not modified.

variables
*********
This argument is ``fixed`` , ``random`` or ``both`` .
If it is ``fixed`` (``random`` )
only the fixed effects (random effects) are optimized.
If it is ``both`` , both the fixed and random effects
are optimized.

fixed
=====
This option optimizes the fixed effects with the
random effects corresponding to
:ref:`constant child value priors<rate_table@Child Value Priors@Constant>`
at their constrained values and the other random effects
constrained to be zero.
(This is equivalent to fitting with
:ref:`option_table@Optimize Random Only@bound_random` equal to zero.)
This is useful when one uses fitting with no random effects as
a starting point for fitting with random effects; see
:ref:`set_command-name` ,
:ref:`start_var_table-name` , and
:ref:`fit_fixed_both.py<user_fit_fixed_both.py-name>` .
This enables one to see the different between the two
fits in the :ref:`log_table-name`
(as apposed to changing
:ref:`option_table@Optimize Random Only@bound_random`
in the ``option`` table).

random
======
This optimizes the random effects with
the fixed effects set to their starting values; see
:ref:`start_var_table-name` .

both
====
This option fits both the
:ref:`fixed<model_variables@Fixed Effects, theta>` and
:ref:`random<model_variables@Random Effects, u>` effects.

simulate_index
**************
If *simulate_index* is present, it must be less than
:ref:`simulate_command@number_simulate` .

data_sim_table
==============
If *simulate_index* is present, this is an extra input table.
The :ref:`data_sim_table@data_sim_value` entries,
corresponding to *simulate_index* ,
are used in place of the data table
:ref:`data_table@meas_value` entries.
All the rest of the data table values
are the same as when *simulated_index* is not present; e.g.,
:ref:`data_table@meas_std` comes from the data table.

prior_sim_table
===============
If *simulate_index* is present, this is an extra input table.
The :ref:`prior_sim_table@prior_sim_value` entries,
corresponding to *simulate_index* ,
are used in place of the prior table
:ref:`prior_table@mean` entries.
All the rest of the prior table values
are the same as when *simulated_index* is not present; e.g.,
:ref:`prior_table@std` comes from the prior table.

warm_start
**********
If ``warm_start`` is at the end of the command, the
:ref:`fit_command@Output Tables@ipopt_info_table`
written by the previous fit,
is used to start the optimization of the fixed effects
where the previous fit left off.
This is intended to be used in the following cases:

#. Termination of previous fit is due to reaching
   :ref:`max_num_iter_fixed<option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@max_num_iter>` .
#. The
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@tolerance` for the
   fixed or random effects been changed.

Other options besides those listed above,
should be the same as for the previous fit.

data_subset_table
*****************
Only the data table rows with :ref:`data_table@data_id`
that also appear in the :ref:`data_subset table<data_subset_table@data_id>`
are included in the fit and residuals.

hold_out
********
A data table :ref:`data_table@meas_value`
is held out from the fit, but included in the residuals,
if any of the following conditions hold:

#. The data table :ref:`data_table@hold_out` is non-zero.
#. The corresponding data_subset table
   :ref:`data_subset_table@hold_out` is non-zero;
   see :ref:`hold_out_command-name` .
#. The data table :ref:`integrand<data_table@integrand_id>`
   corresponds to an :ref:`integrand_table@integrand_name`
   that is in the option table
   :ref:`option_table@hold_out_integrand` list

After the optimal variable values are found,
the hold out residuals are computed so one can check the
predictive validity for hold out data.
The residuals for hold out data (other data) are computed once (many times)
for each fit.

Output Tables
*************

fit_var_table
=============
A new :ref:`fit_var_table-name` is created each time this command is run.
It contains the results of the fit in its
:ref:`fit_var_table@fit_var_value` column.

fit_data_subset_table
=====================
A new :ref:`fit_data_subset_table-name` is created each time this command is run.
It is a comparison of the model and data corresponding to the fit results.

trace_fixed
===========
A new :ref:`trace_fixed_table-name` is created each time a
``fit fixed`` or ``fit both`` command is run.
It contains a trace of the corresponding optimization.

hes_random_table
================
A new :ref:`hes_random_table-name` is created each time this command is run
with *variables* equal to ``random`` or ``both`` .
The Hessian of the random effects objective is written in this table.
If *simulate_index* is present (is not present) the Hessian corresponds
to the simulated measurements in the :ref:`data_sim_table-name`
(measurements in the :ref:`data_table-name` ).

mixed_info
==========
A new :ref:`mixed_info_table-name` table is created each time this command is run.

ipopt_info_table
================
The fixed effect are optimized when
*variables* is equal to ``both`` or ``fixed`` .
In the case a new ``ipopt_info`` table, corresponding to the final
fit for the fixed effects, is written to the ipopt_info table.
The contents of this table are unspecified; i.e., not part of the
dismod_at API and my change.

Random Effects
**************
A model has random effects if one of the
:ref:`rate_table@child_smooth_id` or
:ref:`rate_table@child_nslist_id` is not ``null`` .
In some cases it helps to
first fit with *variables* equal to ``fixed``
and then fit with *variables* equal to ``both`` .

Convergence Problems
********************
The derivative of the fixed effects objective,
at the prior mean for the fixed effects,
is used to scale the fixed effects objective.
If the optimal value for a fixed effect is equal to its prior mean,
its partial derivative at the prior mean is often near zero.
Near zero derivatives, at the prior mean, cause the scaling to be unstable
and result in convergence problems.
You may be able to fix this
by using a uniform distribution, and a different prior mean,
for a fixed effect that does not change.
If this does not work, the data will not determine that fixed effect
and you may have to constrain it to have the value you want.

Ipopt Options
*************
Some of the options in the :ref:`option_table-name` are for controlling
`Ipopt <https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/OPTIONS.html>`_.
You can override these options, or set other options, using a file called
``ipopt.opt`` in the directory where a fit command is run.
Doing so not supported because ``dismod_at``
expects certain options to be set a certain way.
The set of such options that is not specified and may change with time.
