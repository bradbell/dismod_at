# Make a Local Copy an IHME Dismod_at Database
# ############################################
#
# Syntax
# ******
#
#     ``bin/ihme_db.sh`` [ ``--`` *user* ] *relative_dir* *database*
#
# Purpose
# *******
# This script copies a dismod_at database to a local directory
# and then runs the :ref:`db2csv_command-name` on the database.
# This script is only intended to be used by members of IHME
# and to be run from the IHME cluster.
# It can also be run on a computer that has mounted the
# ``/ihme/epi`` and ``/ihme/homes`` directories.
#
# Download
# ********
# You must first change into a directory where you have write permission,
# download :ref:`dismod_at.git<install_unix@Download dismod_at.git>` ,
# and then change into the dismod_at.git directory.
# This script can only be run from the download directory dismod_at.git.
#
# python3
# *******
# You must inform dismod_at where the python3 executable is located.
# The setting for this is in the
# :ref:`run_cmake.sh<run_cmake.sh@python3_executable>` file.
# If that setting is not correct, change it, and then execute the command
#
#     ``bin/run_cmake.sh``
#
# absolute_dir
# ************
# We use *absolute_dir* to refer to an absolute path to a
# directory below which the database is stored before executing this script.
# You must have read permission below this directory
# (but do not need write permission).
# The default value for this directory is
#
#     *absolute_dir* =/ ``ihme/epi/at_cascade``
#
# --user
# ******
# The brackets around ``--`` *user* indicate that this
# command line argument is optional.
# If it is present, *absolute_dir* is the home directory for
# the specified user; i.e.,
#
#     *absolute_dir* =/ ``ihme/homes/`` *user*
#
# relative_dir
# ************
# The command line argument *relative_dir* is the directory,
# relative to the absolute directory,
# where the database is stored before executing this script.
#
# database
# ********
# The command line argument *database*
# is the local name of the database file; i.e.,
# there are no ``/`` characters in *database* .
# The original database is stored in the location
#
#     *absolute_dir* / *relative_dir* / *database*
#
# db2csv
# ******
# The original database is copied to the directory
#
#     ``ihme_db/`` *relative_dir*
#
# relative to the download directory dismod_at.git.
# We refer to this as the local directory.
# The db2csv_command is run on the database.
# The resulting CSV files are all in the local directory.
#
# {xrst_end ihme_db.sh}
