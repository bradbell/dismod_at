Using the Trapezoidal ODE Solver
################################

Rates
*****
The non-zero rates in this example are iota, rho, chi, and omega.
They are all constant in age and time because they each have one smoothing
grid point.

Integrands
**********
The integrands for this example are prevalence, remission, mtexcess,
and mtother.
Modeling the prevalence integrand requires solving the ODE.
The other integrands are direct measurements of the rates.
To be specific, remission measures rho,
mtexcess measures chi, and
mtother measures omega.

Data
****
For each of the integrands there is one data point are
age 50 and time 2000.
No noise is added to the data but it is modeled as if it
had a 10 percent coefficient of variation.

Random Effects
**************
There are no random effects in this example.

rate_case
*********
The rate case for this example is ``trapezoidal`` .
This case has does not require any of the rates to be positive,
so we use a lower limit of one for all the rates.
