Changes and Additions to Dismod_at During 2016
##############################################

mm-dd
*****

12-03
=====

#. The *meas_std* filed was added to the
   data_sim table.
#. The option arguments were added to each
   :ref:`log_table@message_type@command` message in the log table.
#. The :ref:`db2csv_command-name` was modified so that
   :ref:`db2csv_command@data.csv@meas_value` and *meas_std*
   always correspond to the :ref:`data_table-name` .
   The columns
   :ref:`db2csv_command@data.csv@sim_value` and *sim_std*
   correspond to the :ref:`data_sim_table-name` when the previous fit
   used simulated data.
   In addition, some bugs in this command, related to the
   :ref:`fit_command@simulate_index` , were fixed.
#. There was some confusion in the documentation of the columns in the
   :ref:`db2csv_command@predict.csv` file.
   To be specific, it was not clear that these columns correspond
   to the :ref:`avgint_table-name` instead of the :ref:`data_table-name` .
   This has been fixed.
#. The :ref:`log_table@message_type` ``warning``
   was missing in the log file documentation. It has been added.
#. Change the :ref:`simulate_command-name` so that it adjusts
   *meas_std* data_sim table field
   to be relative to the simulated measurements instead of
   using the data table
   :ref:`data_table@meas_std` .

10-31
=====

#. Include documentation for the
   :ref:`covariate<db2csv_command@data.csv@Covariates>` columns in
   the ``data.csv`` file.
#. Improve the documentation for the
   :ref:`predict_table@sample_index` column in the
   predict table. (It refers to variable and not data samples.)
#. Add the :ref:`db2csv_command@predict.csv` output
   file to the ``db2csv`` command.

10-20
=====

#. **API Change** :
   The *fit_simulate_index* option was removed
   from the :ref:`option_table-name`
   and the argument :ref:`fit_command@simulate_index`
   was added to the simulate command.
#. Improve the discussion of the
   :ref:`output tables<data_flow@Output Tables by Table Name>` .
#. Fix some compiler warnings.

10-19
=====

#. **API Change** :
   The argument :ref:`sample_command@number_sample`
   was added to the sample command.
#. **API Change** :
   The *number_simulate* option was removed from the :ref:`option_table-name`
   and the argument :ref:`simulate_command@number_simulate`
   was added to the simulate command.
#. The :ref:`db2csv_command@log.csv` file was added too the
   db2csv command output.

10-18
=====

#. In the :ref:`user_example-name` examples,
   change *name* _ ``dict`` to *name* _ ``table``
   for *name* equal to ``var`` , ``predict`` , and ``sample`` .
   This makes it clearer that they are copies of the corresponding tables
   as a python list of dictionaries; see :ref:`get_table_dict-name` .
#. If :ref:`option_table@Optimize Random Only@bound_random` was zero,
   the :ref:`sample_command-name` would terminate with a ``cppad_mixed``
   error message. This has been fixed. In addition, the random bound documentation
   now includes mention that is not accounted for in the
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` .
#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20161018`` .
   This fixed a bug in ``cppad_mixed``
   logging error messages versus generating asserts.

10-17
=====

#. Improve the invalid prevalence error message.
#. Fix some more warnings on a old compiler (g++4.4.7).
#. Add choice for debug or release build in
   the IHME cluster program ``install_dismod_at.sh`` .
#. In cmake, search the default library directory last.
   This enables choosing a non-default version of a library as
   well as finding the default libraries when needed.
#. Fix assertion when
   ``log_fatal_error`` is false.
#. Add the
   :ref:`run_cmake.sh@system_specific_library_list`
   argument to the cmake install script.

10-16
=====

#. The :ref:`zsum_child_rate.py<user_zsum_child_rate.py-name>`
   example / test was added.
#. There was a bug (that has been fixed) in
   :ref:`create_database-name` .
   This bug would sometimes mark the wrong time index as having a ``null``
   :ref:`smooth_grid_table@dtime_prior_id`
   in the smooth_grid table.
#. Add the
   ``log_fatal_error`` flag
   to the dismod_at configuration.
#. Remove the ``dev::pack_info.cpp`` ``variable_name`` routine.
   (The :ref:`var_table-name` and
   :ref:`db2csv_command@variable.csv` file
   provide this information.)
#. Report invalid prevalence values in the :ref:`log_table-name`
   (in the case were
   ``log_fatal_error`` is true).

10-15
=====
Add the
:ref:`option_table@Zero Sum Constraints@zero_sum_child_rate` option which
constrains the sum of the random effects to be zero.

10-14
=====

#. Fix a warning (that appeared on some systems) about missing braces in
   ``devel/dismod_at.cpp`` .
#. Add option so that user can specify the C++ compiler during the install of
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@ipopt` and
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed`
#. **API Change:**
   the :ref:`data_table@data_name` field
   was added to the data table.

10-13
=====

#. Improve ``bin/install_suitesparse.sh``
   so that it automatically includes the ``metis`` package.
   Note that the proper value for *metis_version* ,
   in the suitesparse install,
   is printed at the end of the ipopt install.
#. Improve the way that
   :ref:`cmake<run_cmake.sh-name>` searches for libraries and reports failure
   to find a particular library.
   The search was failing on a particular Mac system.
#. Advance cppad-20161012. This fixes a problem in the detection of c++ 2011
   feature availability.

10-12
=====

#. Add the option to set the
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Random Only@bound_random` to zero.
#. Change *name* _ ``dict`` to *name* _ ``table`` in the python examples.
   For example, ``data_dict`` was changed to
   :ref:`create_database@data_table` .
#. There was a problem with the
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad` install script
   ``bin/install_cppad.sh`` that caused a compiler error in
   ``forward2sweep.hpp`` when CppAD was not using c++11 features.
   This has been fixed.

10-11
=====
The ``import_cascade.py`` program was removed
(it has not been kept up to date).

09-30
=====

#. A new assert, that checks for infinity or nan results during the integration,
   was added. This should be converted to a more useful error message;
   (this was done on :ref:`whats_new_2016@mm-dd@10-16` ).
   Furthermore, in some cases it can be avoided; see
   :ref:`wish_list@ODE Solution@Large Excess Mortality`
   in the wish list.
#. Use one value for *libdir* for all the install scripts;
   determined by ``bin/libdir.sh`` .
#. Change :ref:`run_cmake.sh-name` to
   use link from build and install prefix to corresponding debug or release
   directories (so same as install scripts).
#. Advance to Ipopt-3.12.6

09-29
=====

#. In the case where ``dismod_at`` is in the prefix,
   build debug and release versions in separate directories; see
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements` .
#. Advance to eigen-3.2.9 and cppad-20160929.
#. There was a bug in the sampling of the random effects during the
   :ref:`sample asymptotic<sample_command@asymptotic>` command
   (found by a gcc-6.2.1 ``-Wmisleading-indentation`` warning).
   This has been fixed.
#. Add a missing ``import sys`` to
   ``db2csv_command.py`` .

09-21
=====
Add the :ref:`db2csv_command@option.csv` table to the
output generated by the command

   ``dismodat.py`` *database* ``db2csv``

08-28
=====
Change
'If the ``fit_command`` has not been run' to
'If the ``fit_command`` has been run' in :ref:`db2csv_command-name` .
Make the same change for the reference to running the ``sample_command`` .

07-29
=====

#. Add the optimizer
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@accept_after_max_steps`
   option to both the fixed and random effects optimization.
#. Correct a problem with detecting the actual random seed in
   the :ref:`user_speed.py-name` speed test.

07-28
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150728`` .
   This should increase the speed of the :ref:`fit_command-name` .
   It should also make it more robust; i.e., work in more cases.
#. The :ref:`user_speed.py-name` example now uses the
   :ref:`fit_command-name` , instead of the :ref:`sample_command-name`
   to fit the simulated data.
#. Add comments about debug and release builds under
   :ref:`run_cmake.sh@build_type` in ``run_cmake.sh`` .
#. Change ``DEBUG`` and ``RELEASE`` to ``debug`` and ``release``
   in
   :ref:`run_cmake.sh-name` and the install for
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@eigen` ,
   :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@suitesparse` ,
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@ipopt` ,
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` .

07-15
=====
In ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh``
change ``cmake_build_type`` to ``build_type`` ; see
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` .
In addition, add this parameter to the install for
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@eigen` ,
:ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@suitesparse` , and
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@ipopt` .
CppAD does not need this choice as it adapter to the choice of
the systems that use it.
Note that the install for ``dismod_at``
must have the same :ref:`run_cmake.sh@build_type`
as
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` .
(This is no longer an issue.)

07-14
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150711`` .
This should increase the speed of the
:ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` version
of the ``sample_command`` .
It also includes a change to optimizing the random effects
that should eventually improve the speed of :ref:`fit_command-name` .
(At this point, the change does not always result in an improvement.)

07-11
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150711`` .
This should give better recovery when the
fixed effects enter a region where the Hessian w.r.t the random effects
it is not positive definite.
To be specific, the optimizer should try backing up the fixed effects and if
that fails, it should exit the optimization and report the value of the
fixed effects.

06-13
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150613`` .
This fixes a bug in the
:ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` version
of the sample command.

06-12
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150612`` .
This removes the choice between ``ipopt`` and ``box_newton``
for optimizing the random effects; see 06-05 below.

06-06
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150606`` .

06-05
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150605`` .
This involved hooking
up new option to choose between ``ipopt`` and ``box_newton``
for optimizing the random effects; see
``random_box_newton`` .
The :ref:`user_speed.py-name` speed test time (on one machine) changed from
``elapsed seconds = 68.09``
to
``elapsed seconds = 42.31``
when *random_box_newton* was changed from ``false`` (the default)
to ``true`` .
The random seed for both cases above was
``random_seed = 1465142803`` .
The results for the two cases were the same.

05-16
=====

#. The ``database2csv`` program has been moved to the
   :ref:`db2csv_command-name` .
#. The ``python_three_command`` installation setting has been changed to the
   :ref:`run_cmake.sh@python3_executable` setting.
#. The dismod_at :ref:`python-name` module is now installed during the
   :ref:`make install<install_unix@dismod_at@Install>` command.
   The ``dismodat.py`` program is also installed by this command; e.g.
   see :ref:`db2csv_command-name` .

05-15
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150515``
   This yields better :ref:`sample_command-name` results
   when the implicit information matrix is not positive definite
   (for diagnostic purposes).
#. Add the ``adaptive`` and ``trace-adaptive`` values for the
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@derivative_test`
   (``derivative_test_fixed`` only).

05-11
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20150511`` .
   This yields sampling when covariance matrix is not positive definite
   (for diagnostic purposes).
#. Add sampling random effects to the wish list items.
#. Add a description of the
   :ref:`model_variables@Age and Time Variation`
   for each of the model variables.

05-10
=====
Fix :ref:`db2csv_command-name` so that it works with
:ref:`smoothing standard deviation multipliers<model_variables@Fixed Effects, theta@Smoothing Standard Deviation Multipliers, lambda>` .
This required adding the
:ref:`db2csv_command@variable.csv@s_id` column to the
``variable.csv`` file.

05-09
=====

#. Change the scaling of fixed effect
   to key off *eta* not ``null`` in value priors; see
   :ref:`scaling<prior_table@eta@Scaling Fixed Effects>` .
   This enables more user choice over which fixed effects get scaled.
#. The error detection for non-positive Hessian (added yesterday) was
   working properly when variables were bound constrained.
#. The :ref:`sample asymptotic<sample_command@asymptotic>`
   command was using the :ref:`scaled<prior_table@eta@Scaling Fixed Effects>`
   information matrix. This has been fixed.
#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160511`` .

05-08
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160508`` .
   This enables one to use
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` statistics
   when the information matrix is singular,
   by setting the :ref:`prior_table@lower` and upper limits
   equal for variables that have non-positive Hessian.
#. This new version of ``cppad_mixed`` also has new random effects simulator
   that uses less memory and less time.
#. During the :ref:`sample_command-name` ,
   detect when the Hessian with respect to a fixed effect is not positive
   and report the corresponding :ref:`var_table@var_id` .

05-07
=====

#. Fix a bug that occurred when the minimum (maximum)
   value in the :ref:`age_table-name` and :ref:`time_table-name` was not
   the first (last) entry.
#. Add a ``db2csv_command`` item
   to the wish list.
#. Start work on ``test/diabetes.py`` (under construction).

05-06
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160506`` to fix a bug in
:ref:`sample asymptotic<sample_command@asymptotic>` when
there are no random effects.

05-05
=====

#. Change the :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@max_num_iter`
   option so that ``-1`` returns the input :ref:`model_variables-name` ,
   and ``0`` , includes the move of the initial variable values
   (to be inside the constraints).
#. Change the :ref:`option_table-name` so that all entries have default values
   and do not need to appear in the table.
#. Add the :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed Only@bound_frac_fixed`
   option.

05-04
=====

#. Print the :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@ipopt`
   library directories during the
   :ref:`install_unix@dismod_at@Cmake Command` .
#. In the :ref:`db2csv_command-name` program,
   change ``fit_res`` , ``fit_dage`` and ``fit_dtime``
   to :ref:`db2csv_command@variable.csv@res_value`
   ``res_dage`` and ``res_dtime`` respectively.
#. Put ``cppad_mixed:`` at the beginning of warnings and error messages
   that come from the
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` package.
#. Add missing ``dev::log_message::message_type`` cases
   to the ``log_message`` documentation.
#. Change :ref:`user_group_mulcov.py-name` to use ``null`` smoothing
   pointer in the middle (not last) covariate multiplier (better test).
#. Change ``test/user/relrisk.py`` tolerance so that the
   ``cppad_mixed`` solution check passes.
#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160504`` .
#. Change the fixed effects optimization so that it uses the Ipopt option
   *nlp_scaling_method* = ``none`` .
   This fixed the remain solution check warnings generated by ``cppad_mixed`` .

05-03
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160503`` .
#. Fix warning in ``devel/utility/pack_info.cpp`` .

05-01
=====

#. Allow for a covariate multiplier
   :ref:`mulcov_table@group_smooth_id` to be null.
   This enables on the include, or drop out, a multiplier by
   only changing one entry the :ref:`mulcov_table-name` .
#. Fix problem with documentation for *sigma*
   that occurred in changes on :ref:`whats_new_2016@mm-dd@04-22` .
#. Fix discussion of
   :ref:`fixed_value@lambda_j`
   in the value prior for fixed effects.
   To be specific, all fixed effects :math:`\theta_j`,
   not just the parent rates,
   have a value prior multiplier :math:`\lambda_j`.

04-28
=====

#. Add the :ref:`metropolis-name` MCMC utility for testing results.
#. Complete implementation and testing of the sample command
   with :ref:`sample_command@method` equal to ``asymptotic`` ;
   see the example and test in :ref:`user_sample_asy.py-name` .

04-27
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160427`` .
#. Add discussion about bounds and
   :ref:`fit_var_table@Lagrange Multipliers` .
#. Remove ``dismod_at::manage_gsl_rng`` and instead use
   ``CppAD::mixed::manage_gsl_rng`` .
   This fixed that use of
   :ref:`option_table@random_seed` so that it applies
   to all ``dismod_at`` simulated values.
#. Add a choice of :ref:`sample_command@method` to the
   sample command. This makes it easier to :ref:`predict<predict_command-name>`
   with the :ref:`model_variables-name` equal to the results of a fit.
   It also provides asymptotic posterior sampling for the model_variables.
#. There were some place in the code where ``dismod_at`` was assuming
   that the minimum  and maximum age and time were the first and last
   entries in the :ref:`age_table-name` and :ref:`time_table-name` respectively.
   This has been fixed.

04-24
=====

#. The :ref:`db2csv_command-name` utility
   has been documented and is now part of the user API.
#. The name of the ``table`` section has been changed to :ref:`database-name` .

04-23
=====

#. Change the data
   :ref:`weighted residual<data_like@Weighted Residual and Likelihood>`
   to be on the measurement values, not the adjusted measurement values.
   This simplifies the weighted residuals and avoids the condition where the
   :ref:`mean_value<mulcov_table@mulcov_type@meas_value>` covariate multipliers
   affect the
   :ref:`adjusted standard deviation<data_like@Adjusted Standard Deviation, delta_i(theta)>` .
#. Add the Lagrange multipliers
   :ref:`fit_var_table@lagrange_value` ,
   ``lagrange_dage`` and ``lagrange_dtime`` to the fit_var table.
#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20160423`` .

04-22
=====

#. Scale (during optimization of fixed effects) all the :ref:`model_variables-name`
   that have a log-Gaussian or log-Laplace distribution for their value prior.
   To be specific, the optimization variables are the offset log transform
   of the corresponding model variables.
#. When there was no data, and prior for the :ref:`model_variables-name`
   was log-Gaussian or log-Laplace, the prior mean was not the optimal estimate.
   This was because the estimate for the model variance affected the
   log-transformed standard deviation *sigma* .
   This was a feature (it agreed with the documentation) but it was not desirable.
   This have been changed so that *sigma* is defined in terms of the
   prior mean and not in terms of the model value.
   The corresponding log-Gaussian wish list item has been removed.

04-21
=====
Change the sample command so that it has a
:ref:`sample_command@method` argument.
Using *method* = ``simulate`` does the same as the
sample command before this change.
The new feature is *method* = ``fit_var`` .
The
:ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` method
is not yet implemented.

04-20
=====

#. Change ``number_sample`` in option table to
   :ref:`simulate_command@number_simulate` .
#. The :ref:`sample_command@method` argument was added
   to the sample command.

04-19
=====

#. In the data_sim table, change ``sample_index`` to
   :ref:`data_sim_table@simulate_index` .
#. In the option table, change ``fit_sample_index`` to
   :ref:`fit_simulate_index<fit_command@simulate_index>` .

04-18
=====
Advance to new version of CppAD and cppad_mixed
this fixes the compiler warnings when building the release version.

04-17
=====
Fix some errors and warnings when
:ref:`run_cmake.sh@build_type` was
``RELEASE`` . Note that release version is about twice as fast
as the debug version (when using the debug version of
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` .

04-11
=====
Initialize the optimization when *max_num_iter_fixed*
is zero, (this does more model checking).

04-09
=====
Advance to a newer version of cppad_mixed.
This has a change so that when
:ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@max_num_iter` is zero,
for the fixed effects optimization problem,
the resulting fixed effects estimate is the same as in the
:ref:`start_var_table-name` .

04-07
=====
Advance to a newer version of cppad_mixed
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).
This has a change to the routine that checks derivatives
of the fixed effects optimization problem.

03-29
=====
Advance to a newer version of cppad_mixed
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).
This has an important bug fix (see ``cppad_mixed`` whats new).

02-26
=====
Advance to a newer version of cppad_mixed
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).
This has an important bug fix (see ``cppad_mixed`` whats new).

02-06
=====
Advance to a newer version of cppad_mixed
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).

01-26
=====

#. Advance to a newer version of cppad_mixed
   (rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).
#. The :ref:`install_unix@System Requirements@suitesparse`
   package is now required.
   This is because one now has the option to use it for Cholesky factorization;
   see the ``cholmod_cholesky`` setting for installing
   :ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` .

01-16
=====
Remove some :ref:`wish_list-name` items that have been completed
and move some others to the
`cppad_mixed <moby.ihme.washington.edu/bradbell/cppad_mixed/wish_list.htm>`_
package.

01-15
=====
Advance to newer version of ``cppad_mixed`` .

01-10
=====
Advance to newer version of ``Eigen`` and ``cppad_mixed`` .
You should rerun ``bin/install_eigen.sh`` and then
``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` .

01-06
=====
The :ref:`avgint_table-name` created by ``import_cascade.py``
had the wrong number of age values. This has been fixed.

01-05
=====
Advance to a newer version of cppad_mixed
(rerun ``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` ).
