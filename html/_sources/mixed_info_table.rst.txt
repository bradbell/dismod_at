The CppAD Mixed Information Table
#################################

Discussion
**********
A new version of this table is created each time a :ref:`fit_command-name` is run.
The table contains information about the size of certain
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed` objects.
It is useful for seeing how the problem setup affects the
size (and hence time) of the problem.
For example, how different the size is when one uses
a :ref:`hold_out_command-name` to sub-sample the data.

Format
******
Each row of this table has the following information:

mixed_info_id
=============
This column
has type ``integer`` and is the primary key for this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

mixed_name
==========
This column
has type ``text`` and has a different value for every row;
i.e., the names are unique and can act as substitutes for the primary key.
Some of the possible values for *mixed_name* are listed below.
There may be other (unspecified) rows in this table.

mixed_value
===========
This column has type ``text`` and is
the value for the corresponding name.

n_fixed
*******
If *mixed_name* is ``n_fixed`` ,
*mixed_value* is the number of fixed effects.

n_random
********
If *mixed_name* is ``n_random`` ,
*mixed_value* is the number of fixed effects.

quasi_fixed
***********
If *mixed_name* is ``quasi_fixed`` ,
*mixed_value* is one (zero) if we are a using a quasi-Newton (Newton)
method for optimizing the fixed effects.

A_nr
****
If *mixed_name* is ``A_nr`` ,
*mixed_value* is the number of rows in the
liner constraint matrix A
(the matrix has *n_fixed* columns).

A_nnz
*****
If *mixed_name* is ``A_nnz`` ,
*mixed_value* is the number of non-zeros in the
liner constraint matrix A.

ran_like_fun.size_var
*********************
If *mixed_name* is ``ran_like_fun.size_var`` ,
*mixed_value* is the number of variables in the
algorithm that maps the fixed and random effects to the part of
the likelihood that depends on the random effects.

fix_like_fun.size_var
*********************
If *mixed_name* is ``fix_like_fun.size_var`` ,
*mixed_value* is the number of variables in the
algorithm that maps the fixed effects to the part of
the likelihood that does not depend on the random effects.
