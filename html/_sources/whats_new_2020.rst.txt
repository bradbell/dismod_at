Changes and Additions to Dismod_at During 2020
##############################################

mm-dd
*****

12-30
=====
The
:ref:`prior_sim_table-name` ,
:ref:`hes_fixed_table-name` ,
and :ref:`hes_random_table-name`
:ref:`output tables<data_flow@Output Tables by Table Name>`
were not being dropped (if they existed) during the :ref:`init_command-name` .
This has been fixed.

12-29
=====
Fix a problem when creating both debug and release builds.
(This was not a problem before 12-22 when build/external moved to external).

12-26
=====

#. Change ``bin/db_simplify.py`` from a Chron's Disease to a Diabetes case.
#. Add a log density item and a
   :ref:`wish_list@Speed` item to the wish list.
   Remove the checkpointing item
   ,and change the conditional item heading to
   :ref:`wish_list@ODE Solution@rate_case` .

12-22
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20201222.
This improves the error messaging during the install of
:ref:`cppad_mixed.sh<install_unix@Special Requirements@cppad_mixed>` .
In addition, this new version avoids ipopt creating of the file
``debug.out`` (when :ref:`run_cmake.sh@build_type` is debug).

12-17
=====

#. The example :ref:`user_sum_residual.py-name` discusses why the sum
   of the weighted residuals is not expected to be zero.
#. Under the heading
   :ref:`install_unix@Paths@PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
   the command option ``--version`` was corrected to ``--modversion`` .
#. The scripts ``bin/csv_summary.py`` and ``bin/db_simplify.py``
   were added. These are undocumented and untested and only meant as examples
   to help diagnose problems.

11-24
=====
Advance :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh-name` version 20201122.
This should speed up the build process.
It requires one to re-build dismod_at.mixed and dismod_at.image.

11-22
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20201124.
This speeds up the build process when multiple processors are available.
It also fixes a problem in ``cppad_mixed.pc`` and thereby removes the need
to specify a prefix for each of the
:ref:`install_unix@Special Requirements` .

11-23
=====

#. Advance to cppad_mixed and :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh-name` version 20201122.
   This simplifies the build process because the script for building
   and installing cppad_mixed, and its dependencies, come from cppad_mixed.
   In addition, it speed up the build process when multiple processors
   are available.
#. **API change** for :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh-name` .
   To be specific, there are now three dismod_at docker images:
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.base` ,
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.mixed` ,
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .
   You must rebuild all of these images.

10-10
=====
Improve the wording in the documentation of
:ref:`prior_table@std` in the prior table.

08-31
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed and :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh-name` version 20200831.
This fixes a bug in the calculation of the first derivative of
the fixed effects objective.
This bug only occurred when ``ldlt_cholmod`` was ``yes`` in
``bin/install_cppad_mixed.sh`` and
the factorization of the random effects Hessian had a permutation
that did not act as its own inverse.
To use the new dock_dismod_at.sh you will have to build a new
:ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .

08-23
=====

#. Fix location of upstream source in
   ``bin/install_eigen`` .
#. Patch Ipopt's source file ``IpIpoptApplication.cpp`` ; see
   `ipopt issue 393 <https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/issues/393>`_.

08-20
=====
Change ``bin/install_ipopt.sh`` to directly download and configure the
necessary third party software (not use coinbrew).

08-16
=====
Improve the debug :ref:`run_cmake.sh@build_type`
so that ipopt and all its libraries also get built for debugging.

07-02
=====

#. Fix a problem with the change on the previous day (see 07-01 below).
   To be specific, the tables for the Hessian with respect to the fixed
   and random effect were not being created in some error cases that
   should create them (to help diagnose the problem).
   This required advancing to cppad_mixed-20200702.
#. Advance the dock_dismod_at.sh
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
   to 20200702.
   This will require building a new
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .

07-01
=====
Dismod_at will exit with an error when the
:ref:`sample_command@Output Tables@sample_table`
is not created by the
:ref:`sample asymptotic<sample_command@asymptotic>` command.
If this is because the fixed effects information matrix is not
positive definite,
the :ref:`hes_fixed_table-name` will contain the information matrix

06-30
=====
Advance to cppad_mixed-20200630.
This fixes a problem where the :ref:`sample_table-name` was invalid after the
:ref:`sample asymptotic<sample_command@asymptotic>` command
when an information matrix that is not positive definite.
Now, in addition to the warning about the information matrix,
the sample table does not exist after the command when this happens.

06-24
=====
Advance to the dock_dismod_at.sh
:ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
to 20200620
This will require building a new
:ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.base`
and then
:ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .

06-20
=====
The :ref:`sample_command@variables` argument was added
to the sample command.
This enables one to get statistics for fitting just the fixed effects.
It is not backward compatible because you will have to include the
*variables* argument in your sample commands.
To get the old behavior, set *variables* to ``both`` .

06-08
=====
Advance to ipopt-3.13.2, cppad-20200606, cppad_mixed-20200608.

05-30
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20200530``
(more work on the adaptive derivative checker).

05-29
=====

#. A check was added for the case where there are more constraints on the random
   effects than there are random effects.
#. Add the :ref:`user_subgroup_mulcov.py-name` example.
   This combines fixed and random effects for both parent/child and
   group/subgroup and for the same rate.
#. The standard deviation was removed from the prior for some
   uniform priors in :ref:`user_bilevel_random.py-name`
   (it was not being used).
#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20200529`` .
   This adds a missing error report when the Hessian w.r.t. the random
   effects is not positive definite at the starting variable values and
   :ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed Only@quasi_fixed` is false.

05-27
=====
Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20200527`` .
This should improve the output generated by the
:ref:`option_table@Optimize Fixed and Random@derivative_test`
``trace-adaptive`` option.

05-21
=====
The :ref:`user_covid_19.py-name` example was added.

05-15
=====
Add another restriction on the :ref:`subgroup_table@group_name` .
To be specific, the only case were a group name can also be a subgroup name
is when the group has only one subgroup and the same name is used for both.
In addition, more subgroup table error checking (that used to be only
in the debug version) is done in the release version of dismod_at.

03-28
=====

#. Add simplification to the scaling of the asymptotic statistics
   in the case were we have
   :ref:`user_hes_fixed_math.py@Scaling Fixed Effects@Optimal Fixed Effects` .
#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20200328`` .
   This a bug in the release version during
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` sampling
   when there are no random effects.

03-27
=====

#. Add the :ref:`user_one_function.py-name` which demonstrates how to
   fit an arbitrary function and ignore the dismod_at
   :ref:`differential equation<avg_integrand@Ordinary Differential Equation>` .
#. Add the :ref:`option_table@rate_case@no_ode` option
   to the rate case in the option table.
   This was necessary to simplify the one function example mentioned above.
#. The :ref:`prior_table@std@Log Scaling` discussion
   for standard deviations in the prior table was edited to make it clearer
   that difference standard deviations are not transformed.
#. The discussion of log transformed standard deviations *sigma*
   was edited to make it clearer why it is different for data
   than it is for priors.
#. Remove incorrect sentence about the simulated random effects depending
   on the simulated fixed effects in the
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` method.

03-26
=====
The ``user_posterior.py`` example was moved to
:ref:`user_sample_asy_sim.py-name` and it was extended to include the
asymptotic sampling method.

03-25
=====

#. Advance to ``cppad_mixed-20200325`` .
   This fixed an assert in the debug version during
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` sampling
   when there are no random effects.
#. If during asymptotic sampling the Hessian of the fixed or random
   effects object is not positive definite, print a warning and do not
   create a sample table (instead of filling the sample table with nulls);
   see :ref:`sample_command@Output Tables@No Sample Table` .
   This fixed a bug where the :ref:`db2csv_command-name` tried to average null values.
#. The sample command asymptotic method uses a normal distribution,
   but the scaled fixed effects variables are normal in the scaled space; see
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic@Fixed Effects Distribution`
#. Add a test of
   :ref:`user_hes_fixed_math.py@Scaling Fixed Effects`
   to the ``hes_fixed_math.py`` example.
#. Advance to the dock_dismod_at.sh
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
   to 20200325.
   This will require building a new
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .

03-24
=====

#. The Hessian tables are now guaranteed to be in row major order; see
   representation for the
   :ref:`hes_fixed<hes_fixed_table@Representation>` and
   :ref:`hes_random<hes_random_table@Representation>` tables.
#. The values in :ref:`hes_fixed_table-name` are now in scaled space; see
   :ref:`prior_table@eta@Scaling Fixed Effects` .
#. Create separate tables, in the data flow section, for the
   :ref:`data_flow@Command Output Tables` and
   :ref:`data_flow@Command Extra Input Tables` .
#. Add the :ref:`db2csv_command@hes_fixed.csv` and
   :ref:`db2csv_command@hes_random.csv` output files
   to the db2csv command.
#. Check the ``hes_random.csv`` file at the end of the
   :ref:`user_hes_random.py-name` example.

03-23
=====

#. Update to using version cppad_mixed-20200319.
   This enables computation of the Hessian of the random effects objective.
#. Add the :ref:`hes_random_table-name` as an output during an
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` sample command.
   Add the :ref:`user_hes_random.py-name` example use of the hes_random table.

03-22
=====

#. Add the :ref:`hes_fixed table<sample_command@Output Tables@hes_fixed_table>`
   as an extra output when computing asymptotic samples.
#. The ``user_asymptotic_math.py`` example
   was renamed to :ref:`user_hes_fixed_math.py-name` because it checks
   the :ref:`hes_fixed_table-name` .
#. Add a connecting sentence about computation before the equations
   for the derivatives of
   :math:`\hat{u}_i ( \theta )` and :math:`g_i ( \theta )`.
#. The asymptotic sampling of the random effects was changed to use the
   a fixed Hessian w.r.t the random effects for all the samples.
   Trying to optimize the random effects given the simulated fixed effects,
   without changing the data, often fails and does not make sense.

03-21
=====
Add the :ref:`user_hes_fixed_math.py-name` example.

03-19
=====
Update to using version cppad_mixed-20200319.
This fixes some asserts during the
:ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` sampling method
in the debug build.

03-18
=====

#. Advance the dock_dismod_at.sh
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
   to 20200318.
   This will require building a new
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .
#. Add the :ref:`sample_command@simulate_index` argument
   to the asymptotic version of the sample command.
   This fixed a bug where the asymptotic statistics for a fit using
   simulated data was using
   :ref:`data_table@meas_value`
   when it should have been using
   :ref:`data_sim_table@data_sim_value` .
#. Fix a bug in the sampling of the random effect using the
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` method.
#. The :ref:`user_speed.py-name` example was improved.
   More documentation was added,
   it has a realistic parent and child grids, and
   it works with both quasi-Newton and Newton method,
   and it includes an example / test of the asymptotic statistics.

03-15
=====

#. Advance the dock_dismod_at.sh
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
   to 20200315.
   This will require building a new
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .
#. The sample command
   :ref:`sample_command@asymptotic` method
   was changed to ignore all the constraints except for
   :ref:`model_variables-name` that have their upper and lower limits equal.
   This should speed up the computation of the asymptotic statics.
   It also provides a way to approximation the Hessian of the fixed effect
   objective (as the inverse of the sample covariance).
   Note that the simulated samples may be outside the bounds for the
   corresponding variables;
   see :ref:`sample_command@Bounds` .
   Also note that the :ref:`predict_command-name` censors the samples
   to be within their limits before computing its predictions.
#. Some minor corrections were made to the discussion of the
   :ref:`user_sample_asy.py-name` example; e.g.
   :math:`\iota_c` and :math:`\iota_m` where changed to :math:`\iota_n`.
   In addition, the
   :ref:`user_sample_asy.py@Problem Parameters`
   were include in the documentation.

03-09
=====

#. There was a bug in the smoothing when there was a
   upper or lower bound in the prior for
   :ref:`dage<smooth_grid_table@dage_prior_id>` or
   :ref:`dtime<smooth_grid_table@dtime_prior_id>` prior
   for a fixed effect that was scaled; see
   :ref:`prior_table@eta@Scaling Fixed Effects` .
   This has been fixed.
#. Advance the dock_dismod_at.sh
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
   to 20200309.
   This will require building a new
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .

03-06
=====
The ``jump_at_age.py`` example has been improved
to include more discussion and the flexibility to change its
:ref:`user_jump_at_age.py@Parameters` .

02-29
=====

#. Add the :ref:`user_residual.py-name` example.
#. If the user specified the
   :ref:`option_table@Parent Node@parent_node_id`
   in the option table, the corresponding parent node name is placed in the
   :ref:`db2csv_command@option.csv` .

02-28
=====
Fix the formula for the age smoothing :ref:`smooth_dage@A^s` ,
and the time smoothing :ref:`smooth_dtime@T^s` .
To be specific, the forward index comes before the current index; e.g.,
:math:`D(v_{i,j}, v_{i+1,j} \ldots )` was replaced by
:math:`D(v_{i+1,j}, v_{i,j} \ldots )`.

02-26
=====

#. Add an :ref:`wish_list@Immunity` wish list item.
#. Discuss the difference between the weighted residual in the log scaled
   :ref:`statistic@Weighted Residual Function, R@Value`
   and the log scaled
   :ref:`statistic@Weighted Residual Function, R@Difference`
   cases.
#. Discuss the difference in the definition of the
   :math:`\sigma` in the data versus prior cases.

02-20
=====
Advance the dock_dismod_at.sh
:ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
to 20200218.
This will require building a new
:ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .

02-18
=====
The ``dismod_at`` program would crash if the
*subgroup_id* in the
:ref:`data_table<data_table@subgroup_id>` or
:ref:`avgint_table<avgint_table@subgroup_id>` as null.
This has been fixed by detecting this case and printing an error message.

02-14
=====
The description of the :ref:`data_table@hold_out` data
has been improved.

02-13
=====

#. The :ref:`age_table@age_id` and :ref:`time_table@time_id`
   values in the :ref:`smooth_grid_table-name` and :ref:`weight_grid_table-name` were
   not being checked for validity.
   This has been changed so that the user gets an informative error message
   when they are outside the valid limits.
#. Advance the dock_dismod_at.sh
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
   to 20200213.
   This will require building a new
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .

01-31
=====
A :ref:`wish_list@Simulating Priors` entry
was added to the wish list.

01-16
=====
Add an optimizer warm start
wish list item.

01-08
=====

#. Add documentation for the arguments
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Run New Container@database` and
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Run New Container@command` under
   running a new container.
#. Advance the dock_dismod_at.sh
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at_version`
   to 2020010.
   of ``dock_dismod_at.sh`` .
   This will require building a new
   :ref:`dock_dismod_at.sh@Building Images@dismod_at.image` .

01-07
=====
Fix the following compile error when ``NDEBUG`` is not defined:

| |tab| .../ ``devel/table/get_subgroup_table.cpp:128:31: error:``
| |tab| ``'subgroup_id'`` ``was not declared in this scope``
