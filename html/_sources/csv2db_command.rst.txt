# Conversion of a Csv File to a Dismod_at Database
# ################################################
#
# Deprecated
# **********
# This command was deprecated on 2021-12-05.
#
# Syntax
# ******
#
# As Program
# ==========
# ``dismodat.py`` *database* *csv2db* *configure_csv* *measure_csv*
#
# As Python Function
# ==================
# ``dismod_at.csv2db_command`` ( *database* , *configure_csv* , *measure_csv* )
#
# See Also
# ********
# :ref:`get_started-name`
#
# Example
# *******
# This command has limited capability and is only meant as an example
# to help one get started using dismod_at.
# See :ref:`user_csv2db.py-name` for an example that uses this command.
#
# mtall
# *****
# The all cause mortality data ``mtall``
# in the *measure_csv* file has special meaning.
# We assume it has been converted to constraints on other cause
# mortality; see :ref:`csv2db_command@mtother` below.
# For this reason, it should not be included when fitting,
# and is only in *measure_csv* as a check that the desired values
# are satisfied (by checking residuals in a data fit).
# For this reason, :ref:`csv2db_command@hold_out` must be
# one for all the ``mtall`` data; i.e., it is not included during a fit.
#
# mtother
# *******
#
# Constraint
# ==========
# The other cause mortality data ``mtother``
# in the *measure_csv* file has special meaning.
# It is intended to represent the all cause mortality data
# as constraints on other cause mortality in the model.
# To be specific, the :ref:`csv2db_command@meas_value`
# is a constraint on :math:`\omega` at the corresponding age-time pairs.
#
# Age-Time Pairs
# ==============
# Each row with *integrand* = ``mtother`` must have
# *age_lower* == *age_upper* and
# *time_lower* == *time_upper* .
#
# Rectangular Grid
# ================
# The ``mtother`` data must be specified on a rectangular grid; i.e.,
# each age that appears, appears in one and only one row for every time
# that appears.
# This property can also be stated as
# each time that appears, appears in one and only one row for every age
# that appears.
#
# hold_out
# ========
# The :ref:`csv2db_command@hold_out` must be
# one for all the ``mtother`` data because
# it is a constraint, not data, during a fit.
#
# Rate Grid
# =========
# All of the
# :ref:`non zero rates<csv2db_command@configure_csv@non_zero_rates>`
# use the age-time grid corresponding the ``mtother`` data.
# In other words, they are modeled as piecewise bilinear between the
# age-time points at which ``mtother`` is specified.
#
# Predictions
# ***********
# The :ref:`avgint_table-name` is set up so that
# :ref:`predictions<predict_command-name>` for the integrands
# :ref:`csv2db_command@integrand@Sincidence` ,
# :ref:`csv2db_command@integrand@remission` ,
# :ref:`csv2db_command@integrand@mtexcess` ,
# corresponding to the value of the rates iota, rho, chi on the
# :ref:`csv2db_command@mtother@Rectangular Grid` .
# Only the non-zero rates are included.
# Predictions for
# :ref:`csv2db_command@integrand@prevalence` in the
# rectangular grid are also included.
#
# database
# ********
# This argument
# is an ``str`` containing the name of the dismod_at database
# file that is written by this command.
#
# configure_csv
# *************
# This argument
# is an ``str`` containing the configuration file name and must
# end with the ``.csv`` extension.
# The first row contains the following column names
# ``name`` , ``value`` .
# Column names that begin with ``c_`` are comments
# and will not be used by future versions of ``csv2db`` .
# The configuration options are documented by the corresponding
# name below.
#
# non_zero_rates
# ==============
# The *value* in this row is a list rates that are non-zero
# in the model.
# The possible rates are
# ``pini`` , ``iota`` , ``rho`` , ``chi`` , ``omega`` .
# The rates in the list are separated by a single space
# and ``omega`` must appear in the list.
# There is no default value for this value; i.e., it must appear.
#
# measure_csv
# ***********
# is an ``str`` containing the data file name
# and must end with the ``.csv`` extension.
# Each row of the data file corresponds to one data point.
# The first row of the file contains the column names.
# The other rows correspond to data points.
# Each column of the necessary columns in the data file is documented
# under its column name below.
# Column names that begin with ``c_`` are comments
# and will not be used by future versions of ``csv2db`` .
#

#

# This column of *measure_csv* contains
