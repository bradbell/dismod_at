# | |tab| *connection* , *tbl_name* , *col_name* , *col_type* , *row_list*
# | )
#
# connection
# **********
# is a :ref:`create_connection@connection` for this database.
#
# tbl_name
# ********
# is a ``str`` that specifies the name of the table.
#
# col_name
# ********
# is a ``list`` of ``str``
# where the elements are the column names in the table that is created.
# The column name for the primary key, *tbl_name* _ ``id`` must

# unique
# ======
# If the column name *tbl_name* _ ``name`` is in the list,
# the corresponding column will have the ``unique`` constraint.
#
# col_type
# ********
# is a ``list`` of ``str`` where the elements are the column types
# in the same order as *col_name* .
# The valid types are
# ``integer`` , ``real`` , ``text`` .
#
# row_list
# ********
# is a possibly empty ``list`` of rows contain data that is written
# to the table.
# Each row is itself a list containing the data for one row of the
# table in the same order as *col_name* .
# Note that the primary key column is not included in *row_list* .
# Also note that the value in each column gets converted to unicode
# before being written to the database.
# Note that the special value
#
#     *row_list* [ *i* ][ *j* ] == ``None``
#
# gets converted to ``null`` in the table.
#
# tbl_name_id
# ***********
# A column with name *tbl_name* _ ``id`` and type
