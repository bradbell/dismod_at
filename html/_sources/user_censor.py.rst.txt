# Fitting Data That Has Negative Values Censored
# ##############################################
#
# Purpose
# *******
# This example uses the
# :ref:`density_table@density_name@cen_gaussian`
# density to represent data that is has its negative value replaced by zero.
#
# Problem Parameters
# ******************
# The following values are used to simulate the data and set the priors
# for fitting the data:
# {xrst_literal
#     begin problem parameters
#     end problem parameters
# }
#
# Age and Time Values
# *******************
# The age and time values do not matter for this problem
# because all the functions are constant in age and time.
# This can be seen by the fact that all of the smoothings have one age
# and one time point.
#
# Variables
# *********
# There is one model variable for this example *iota_true*
# :ref:`iota<avg_integrand@Rate Functions@iota_i(a,t)>`
# the true value used to simulate the data.
#
# Rate Table
# **********
# The :ref:`rate_table-name` only specifies that *iota* for the parent
# is the only nonzero rate for this example.
# In addition, it specifies the smoothing for that rate which has only
# one grid point. Hence there is only one model variable corresponding to
# the rates.
#
# Data Table
# **********
# For this example, all the data is
# :ref:`avg_integrand@Integrand, I_i(a,t)@Sincidence` ,
# with a Gaussian density, with mean *iota_true*
# and standard deviation 2* *iota_true* .
# The data is then censored, to be specific,
# values below zero are replaced by the value zero.
#
# Prior Table
# ***********
# There is one prior in the :ref:`prior_table-name` for the only
# model variable.
#
# Discussion
# **********
# This fits two data sets.
# The first is simulated using python and put in the :ref:`data_table-name` .
# The second is simulated using the :ref:`simulate_command-name`
# and put in the :ref:`data_sim_table-name` .
