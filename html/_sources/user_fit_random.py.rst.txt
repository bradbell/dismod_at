Purpose
*******
This example demonstrates using the command

    ``dismod_at`` *database* ``fit random``

See the :ref:`fit_command@variables@random` option
to fit the fit command.

Discussion
**********
The following describes the model and data for this example:

#. The :ref:`age_table-name` has values
   ``0.0`` , ``50.0`` , ``100.0`` .
   The :ref:`time_table-name` has values
   ``1995.0`` , ``2005.0`` , ``2015.0`` .
#. The parent node is North America, the child nodes are
   Canada and the United States.
#. The only :ref:`model_variables-name` in this example are
   :ref:`rate_table@rate_name@iota` for the parent and the
   corresponding random effects for two children.
   These rates are modeled as constant with respect to age and
   linear between time 1995 and 2015.
   The true iota is

   .. csv-table::
       :widths: auto

       0.01,North America
       0.01 * exp(+0.5),United States
       0.01 * exp(-0.5),Canada

   Note that the random effect for the United States is +0.5
   and for Canada it is -0.5.
#. There are three measurements, one for each node.
   All the measurements are at age 50 and time 2000
   (there is no age or time interval for the data points).
   The measurement value is exactly equal to the true value of *iota*
   for the corresponding node.
   The measurement noise is modeled to have a 10 percent coefficient
   of variation (even though there is no noise in the actual measurements).
#. The prior for North America is a uniform with mean equal to the
   true value for the United States.
   The prior for Canada and the United States is a Gaussian with mean zero and
   standard deviation 100.
   The large standard deviation is so that it does not have much effect.
#. The prior for the difference in *iota* between time 1995
   and time 2015 for the children (parent) is a Gaussian (log Gaussian)
   with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1.
#. The init command is used to set the
   :ref:`init_command@start_var_table` equal to the
   prior mean.
   The prior means for North America (the fixed effects) are not their
   true values and the optimal values for the random effects
   compensate for this.
