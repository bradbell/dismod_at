True Values Used During Simulations
###################################

Discussion
**********
The truth_var table contains one value for each of the
:ref:`model_variables-name` .
The :ref:`set_command<set_command@table_out@truth_var>`
can be used to create a truth_var table.
This table may also be created directly by the user
(with the aid of the :ref:`var_table-name` ).

truth_var_id
************
This column has type ``integer`` and is the primary key for this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.
The *truth_var_id* column is also a foreign key for the
:ref:`var_table-name` ; i.e.,

   *var_id* = *truth_var_id*

In addition, the size of both tables is the same.

truth_var_value
***************
The column has type ``real`` and is
the value of the :ref:`model_variables-name`
used during the :ref:`simulate_command-name` .

Example
*******
See the :ref:`set_command.py<set_command.py@truth_var Table>`
example and test.
