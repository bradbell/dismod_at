# ####################################

# Syntax
# ******
# {xrst_literal
#     BEGIN syntax
#     END syntax
# }
#
# Purpose
# *******
# This routine provides variations on the following steps:
#
# #. Print the system command as it would appear in the shell; i.e.,
#    with arguments separated by spaces.
# #. Run the system command and wait for it to complete.
# #. Check the integer value returned by the system command.
#    If it is non-zero, an assert exception is raised with
#    stderr as the message in the exception.
# #. Return the contents of standard out as a python string.
#
# command
# *******
# is a ``list`` with ``str`` elements. The first element is the
# program to execute and the other elements are arguments to the program.
#
# print_command
# *************
# If this argument is true (false) the command will (will not) be printed
# before it is executed.
#
# return_stdout
# *************
# If this argument is true, the command's standard output will be returned.
# If this argument is false and *file_stdout* is not None,
# standard error will be written to a file during the command execution.
# Otherwise, standard output will be printed during the command execution.
#
# return_stderr
# *************
# If this argument is true, the command's standard error will be returned.
# If this argument is false and *file_stderr* is not None,
# standard error will be written to a file during the command execution.
# Otherwise, if an error occurs, an assertion is generated with
# the commands standard error as the corresponding message.
#
# file_stdout
# ***********
# If *return_stdout* is true, this argument must be None.
# If this argument is not None, it is a file object that is opened for writing
# and standard output will be written to this file.
#
# file_stderr
# ***********
# If *return_stderr* is true, this argument must be None.
# If this argument is not None, it is a file object that is opened for writing
# and standard error will be written to this file.
#
# write_command
# *************
# If *write_command* is true (false) the command will
# (will not) be written to *file_stdout* .
# If *file_stdout* is None, *write_command* must be false.
#
# result
# ******
#
# #. If *return_stdout* and *return stderr* are both false,
#    *result* is ``None`` .
# #. If *return_stdout* is true and *return_stderr* is false,
#    *result* is a ``str`` with the contents of standard output.
# #. If *return_stderr* is true and *return_stdout* is false,
#    *result.stderr*
#    is an ``str`` with the contents of standard error,
#    and *result.returncode*
#    is an ``int`` with the command's return code..
# #. If both *return_stderr* and *return_stdout* are true,
#    *result.stderr*
#    is an ``str`` with the contents of standard error,
#    *result.stdout*
#    is an ``str`` with the contents of standard output,
#    and *result.returncode*
#    is an ``int`` with the command's return code..
#
# Example
# *******
# Many of the :ref:`user_example-name` examples use this utility.
