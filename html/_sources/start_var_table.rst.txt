Starting Values Used During a Fit
#################################

Discussion
**********
The start_var table contains one value for each of the
:ref:`model_variables-name` .
The :ref:`init_command<init_command@start_var_table>`
creates a start_var table
using the mean of the priors for the model variables values.
The :ref:`set_command<set_command@table_out@start_var>`
can also be used to create a start_var table.
This table may also be created directly by the user
(with the aid of the :ref:`var_table-name` ).

start_var_id
************
This column has type ``integer`` and is the primary key for this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.
The *start_var_id* column is also a foreign key for the
:ref:`var_table-name` ; i.e.,

   *var_id* = *start_var_id*

In addition, the size of both tables is the same.

start_var_value
***************
The column has type ``real`` and is
the value of the :ref:`model_variables-name`
where the optimization procedure is started during the
:ref:`fit_command-name` .

Example
*******
See the :ref:`init_command.py-name` example and test.
