.. meta::
   :keywords: weight_grid_id

.. index:: weight_grid_id

.. _weight_grid_table@weight_grid_id:

weight_grid_id
**************
This column has type ``integer`` and is the primary key for
the ``weight_grid`` table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

.. meta::
   :keywords: weight_id

.. index:: weight_id

.. _weight_grid_table@weight_id:

weight_id
*********
This column has type ``integer`` and is a
:ref:`weight_table@weight_id` in the weight table.
Each *weight_id* value corresponds to a different weighting.

.. meta::
   :keywords: age_id

.. index:: age_id

.. _weight_grid_table@age_id:

age_id
******
This column has type ``integer`` and is a
:ref:`age_table@age_id` in the age table.
Each *age_id* value corresponds to a specific age.

.. meta::
   :keywords: time_id

.. index:: time_id

.. _weight_grid_table@time_id:

time_id
*******
This column has type ``integer`` and is a
:ref:`time_table@time_id` in the time table.
Each *time_id* value corresponds to a specific time.

.. meta::
   :keywords: weight

.. index:: weight

.. _weight_grid_table@weight:

weight
******
This column has type ``real`` .
For each row in the table, the value in this column
is the weighting, at the corresponding age and time,
and for the specified *weight_id* ,
Each value in this column must be greater than zero.

.. meta::
   :keywords: rectangular, grid

.. index:: rectangular, grid

.. _weight_grid_table@Rectangular Grid:

Rectangular Grid
****************
For each fixed value of *weight_id*
the set of *age_id* , *time_id* pairs is rectangular.
In other words,
if an *age_id* value appears,
it appears once with each *time_id*
that appears with this *weight_id* .
This also means,
if a *time_id* value appears,
it appears once with each *age_id*
that appears with this *weight_id* .
