#
# Integrands
# **********
# There is an integrand that directly measures each of the model rates; i.e.,
# :ref:`avg_integrand@Integrand, I_i(a,t)@Sincidence` ,
# :ref:`avg_integrand@Integrand, I_i(a,t)@remission` ,
# :ref:`avg_integrand@Integrand, I_i(a,t)@mtexcess` , and
# :ref:`avg_integrand@Integrand, I_i(a,t)@mtother` .
# In addition the integrand prevalence is included, but is data values
# are for age zero which corresponds to the
# :ref:`rate_table@rate_name@pini` rate.
#
# Nodes
# *****
# There are four nodes in this example.
# The world node has one child, north_america.
# The north_america node has two children, united_states and canada.
# The :ref:`parent_node<option_table@Parent Node>` is canada which
# does not have any children.
#
# Data
# ****
# All of the data corresponds to canada.
# There is one data point for each integrand and it is the true value
# for the corresponding rate; i.e., there is no noise in this data.

# Outlier
# =======
# There is also one outlier at the end of the data table with
# :ref:`data_table@hold_out` equal to one.
#
# Smoothing
# *********
# There is a smoothing the for each of the possible rates for the
# parent node canada.
# There is no child node smoothing.
# The value priors for this smoothing is uniform with lower limit 1e-4
# and upper limit 1.0. The mean 0.1, is only used as a starting point
# for the optimization.
# The time difference prior for this smoothing is
# gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation 1e-2.
