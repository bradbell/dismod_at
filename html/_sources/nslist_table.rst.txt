#############################

Discussion
**********
This table uses
:ref:`nslist_pair_table@nslist_id` to attach
a name to each list in the ``nslist_pair`` table.

nslist_id
*********
This column has type ``integer`` and is the primary key for
the this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

nslist_name
***********
This column has type ``text`` and has a different value for every row;
i.e., the names are unique and can act as substitutes for the primary key.
The names are intended to be easier for a human to remember than the ids.
