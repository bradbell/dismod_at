The Density Table
#################

Discussion
**********
The ``density`` table is used to identify densities.
It has the following columns:

density_id
**********
This column has type ``integer``
and is the primary key for this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.

density_name
************
This column has type ``text`` .
This column is unique; i.e., each name can only appear ones in this table.
All of the *density_id* values that appear in the
:ref:`prior<prior_table@density_id>` and
:ref:`data<data_table@density_id>` tables
must appear in the density table.
Below is a list of the possible density names
with a link to the corresponding meaning:

uniform
=======
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Uniform`

gaussian
========
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Gaussian`

cen_gaussian
============
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Censored Gaussian`

log_gaussian
============
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Log-Gaussian`

cen_log_gaussian
================
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Censored Log-Gaussian`

laplace
=======
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Laplace`

cen_laplace
===========
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Censored Laplace`

log_laplace
===========
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Log-Laplace`

cen_log_laplace
===============
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Censored Log-Laplace`

students
========
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Student's-t`

log_students
============
:ref:`statistic@Log-Density Function, D@Log-Student's-t`
