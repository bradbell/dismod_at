Which Variables The Model Depends On
####################################

Purpose
*******
This table is created by the :ref:`depend_command-name` and
is not used by any commands.
It is only meant as a diagnostic to see if the model has more
variables than necessary; e.g.,
random effects with not associated data.

depend_var_id
*************
This column has type ``integer`` and is the primary key for this table.
Its initial value is zero, and it increments by one for each row.
The *depend_var_id* column is also a foreign key for the
:ref:`var_table-name` ; i.e.,

   *depend_var_id* = *var_id*

In addition, the size of both tables is the same.

data_depend
***********
This column type ``integer`` and is either zero or one.
If it is one (zero), the model for the data does (does not) depend on the
:ref:`model_variable<model_variables-name>` corresponding to this
:ref:`var_table@var_id` .

prior_depend
************
This column type ``integer`` and is either zero or one.
If it is one (zero), the model for the prior does (does not) depend on the
:ref:`model_variable<model_variables-name>` corresponding to this
:ref:`var_table@var_id` .

Example
*******
See the :ref:`depend_command.py-name` example and test.
