# Example Using The Node Covariate Table
# ######################################
#
# Purpose
# *******
# This example demonstrates using the
# :ref:`node_cov_table-name` .
#
# True Value of Variables
# ***********************
# The values of the unknown variables that is used to
# simulate the data are
# {xrst_literal
#     BEGIN_TRUE_VALUE
#     END_TRUE_VALUE
# }
#
# Integrand
# *********
# There is only one integrand in this example,
# :ref:`avg_integrand@Integrand, I_i(a,t)@prevalence` .
#
# Node Tables
# ***********
# The node table for this example is
# ::
#
#                   world
#                  /     \
#     north_america       south_america
#
# Subgroup Table
# **************
# For this example there is only one group (the world).
#
# Covariates
# **********
# There is one covariate in this example and it is, *normalized_age*
# (age divided by 100).
#
# Covariate Multipliers
# *********************
# There is one covariate multiplier in this example.
# It multiples *normalized_age* and effects the rate iota.
# Previous values for the covariate affect previous values for iota,
# which in turn affects the value of prevalence at the measurement time.
#
# Simulated Data
# **************
# The data is simulated using the true value for the variables,
# and the covariate effects mentioned above. No noise is added to the data,
# but it is modeled as having a ten percent coefficient of variation.
#
# Rate Variables
# **************
# There is one non-zero rate for this example iota
# and the no effect model for iota is constant and equal to
# ``iota_no_effect`` .
#
# Covariate Multipliers Variables
# *******************************
# There is one covariate multiplier for this example
# and it is constant and affects iota
# (but the value of the covariate, normalized age, is not constant).
